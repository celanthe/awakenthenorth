Please know I usually work with full use of my brain, but I don't recall
a sign in and password section, but as my phone kept glitching I truly
have no idea what I put down. I am not usually this ditsy.
If you could help me figure it out. I tried to change it with forgot
password, but it failed to send me a link email.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
