The "It Could Happen to You" Experiment

Note for the New York 60th Precinct Police. Please humor me for a moment
because this next experiment may involve you. I've been performing these
bizarre paranormal research experiments recently where I run fictional
movies into my bedroom mirror late at night during the invocation of
Goddess Spirits and Demons and such, and then a few days later an incident
winds up on Social Media News that ironically mirrors the effects of the
fictional movie plots I screened. However, in order for this gag to work,
the film has to have some kind of basis element that can be translated into
scientific reality.

I'll try to keep the opening short to bring you up to speed. The Curse of
Ah My Goddess, the anime show, is when the Three Real Goddesses from Norse
Mythology are invoked, they showcase themselves by causing a "glitch in the
matrix" where stranger than fiction incidents happen surrounded by IRONY,
SERENDIPITY, or COINCIDENCE, sometimes relating back to the names Verdandi,
Urdr, Skolde, Mara, or Norse Mythology in General.

What I have stumbled upon, within the making of a fan film version of the
Ah My Goddess anime series, is like if a Tales from the Crypt scenario were
to happen in real life. The show has developed a spiritual attachment like
a Ouija Board Haunting because Kosuke Fujishima named the characters after
real life spiritual deities from a Pagan Witchcraft religion that we all
assumed to be a work of fiction. But all of the evidence I've seen suggests
these Spirits that manipulate Fate are Real, thought they may be called by
different names. The implication is that the Franchise Success behind the
Ah My Goddess anime in Japan is that Kosuke Fujishima was so obsessed with
his subject matter, that he accidentally invoked the Real Goddesses, and
they interpreted his Manga Series as a Sacrificial Offering to them in the
form of publicity for their Goddesses and their Religion so they rewarded
his series with extreme Good Fortune, and now their images are Franchise
plastered all over Japan Pop Culture everywhere like Mickey Mouse, unaware
to Kodansha Ltd that what they've basically done is they've accidentally
created a brand new form of False Idolatry for the Goddesses because all of
their fans who find out they have a basis in reality wishfully believe that
the real Goddesses in the Afterlife are the ones they've fallen in love
with from the Television Show. But they're not. In real life, those
Goddesses are responsible for the Birth, Life, and Deaths of everyone on
Planet Earth including everyone reading this email. And that gives them an
unexpected Dark Side that nobody appears to be taking seriously except
Kevin Neece himself.

One night during an Spirit Invocation, Kevin Neece screened Gone With the
Wind, then he said out loud that the reason he did this was because
Kodansha Ltd was about to become "Gone with the Wind" due to a curse he had
placed on their Company CEO for refusing to respond to him about the matter
for four years and putting him on an industry blacklist. When the movie was
over, it was announced online that a 7.6 Earthquake hit Miyagi Prefecture
in Japan.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japan-earthquake-shaking-buildings-even-in-tok=
yo/

I then got the most twisted unbelievable idea ever. This was jokingly
inspired by a Sean Connery villain from the 1998 Avengers movie with Uma
Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. In the movie, Sean Connery plays Sir Augustus
DeWynter, who takes the world hostage by staging a bunch of terrorist
attacks in the form of Natural Disaster events using a machine that can
control the weather.

Starting near the end of March 20th 2021:

For the first experiment, this immediate thought came to mind. If I were to
screen Dante's Peak and Tommy Lee Jones Volcano, does that mean that a
dormant volcano would erupt? That's exactly what I did. And during the
movie, I jokingly dared them to do it over and over again. The next
morning, it was announced on the News that a 6,000 year old dormant volcano
erupted in Iceland, which is where Norse Mythology originates from.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iceland-volcano-fagradals-mountain-eruption-do=
rmant-for-6000-years/

Taking the experiment even further, on the next night I screened Jan De
Bont's Twister, daring them to touch down several F5 tornadoes within the
next 48 hours. The next day, it looked like everything was calm and nothing
on the horizon, with only a slight 30% on a Wednesday. Within 48 hours the
dynamic drastically changed and it was reported that multiple F4 and F5
tornadoes touched down in the Mississippi areas.

https://abcnews.go.com/US/storm-produce-tornadoes-south-weekend/story?id=3D=
76700550

As Police Officers, I would have you all take note that all of these
Natural Disaster Events are happening within days of each other near the
end of March. It's because I screened the Disaster movies within days of
each other during that time period.

I also screened Wolfgang Peterson's The Perfect Storm and Poseidon
Adventure remake that night. I believe the reason the Perfect Storm test
failed is because I requested a recreation of the events on location
unaware that the incident took place in October, thus being called "The
Halloween Storm". The Poseidon Adventure cruise ship capsize failed to hit
it's 48 hour mark as well but on April 4, 2021 it was reported that a
Cruise Ship capsized in China, which falls within a week or so of the
screening.

https://newstalk941.com/hundreds-missing-after-china-cruise-ship-capsizes/

The next day or so, I went for the ridiculous one. I screened Michael Bay's
Armageddon and Deep Impact, my curse victim was Vladimir Putin, and I was
trying to dare the Goddesses to smash Russia with a Meteor. While this
incident did not happen, it isn't as stupid as you think it is. After
checking online, I discovered that two days earlier a Meteor large enough
to destroy a whole country just passed by Planet Earth missing it, and in
2013, Russia was hit by a meteor that killed and injured nearly 1,000
people. I had the right idea, I just missed the mark by a few days.

https://www.cnet.com/news/huge-asteroid-2021-eq3-zoomed-safely-past-the-ear=
th/

Next on the disaster list was an experiment in Fate where I screened the
Dwayne Johnson movies San Andreas and Skyscraper to see if Fate could be
manipulated to put Dwayne Johnson through the motions of real life similar
events to what was in the movie, only being played out in real life back to
back in one week. Basically Dwayne Johnson is Fate's Guinea Pig.This
experiment was run around March 28, 2021 and this was reported on April
5th. Dwayne Johnson's whereabouts during the incident are still unknown to
me. If he was halfway around the world shooting a movie at the time the
incident happend then the experiment kind of failed to be honest even
though an earthquake did happen. It wasn't THE BIG ONE because the San
Andreas movie is over the top Hollywood Green Screen bullshit that does not
match up to Reality.

tml

The final test involving War Games, Watchmen Ultimate Cut, The Day the
Earth Stood Still, Roland Emmerich's The Day after Tomorrow and 2012 were
specifically curse aimed at the countries threatening the United States
with Nuclear War, CHINA, RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA, with no set due date other
than a few warning signs for the CIA and the Pentagon to watch out for. The
idea is inspired by the movie Watchmen. The reason the United States is
afraid to attack these countries in pre-emptive self defense is because
they will launch their missiles in retaliation. But what if these countries
Nuclear Weapons were disarmed by Hackers leaving them defenseless, and then
they were wiped out by a Natural Disaster Act of God, unaware that it was
secretly an attack by someone playing "God in the Machine" in the United
States, such as the Earthquake in Roland Emmerich's 2012. It's exactly like
the end of the movie Watchmen. Ozymandias harnessed the Destructive Power
of the Gods launching an attack that wiped out millions, but it was done in
the service of deterring and preventing a Nuclear War standoff that would
have killed billions. Ozymandias "practical joke" was a blood sacrifice
intended to prevent the total destruction of Planet Earth. Mankind's
punishment for flirting with the possibility of Nuclear War like it was a
North Korean Dick Measuring Contest. Kevin Neece is Ozymandias, and the
Three Goddesses of Fate and their "Natural Disaster Acts of God" represent
Doctor Manhattan. The Pirate Captain's Quest in Tales of the Black
Freighter represents the damnation of Kevin Neece's soul as these
experiments have resulted in him being spirit wife married to an unknown
Succubus Demon, with the side effect that he can now invoke these dangerous
entities without suffering from any kind of misfortune backlash side
effects..

Moving on however, we now come to the 60th Precinct of New York City, which
is where I'm told Officer Robert Cunningham used to work during the 1985
Lottery Winning Incident that inspired Nicolas Cage's "It Could Happen to
You". Once again, in order for these spells to work, there has to be a
basis in reality, so using a film that was based on a true story makes
sense in this paranormal experiment.

Now that you are all brought up to speed, here is the final article.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "It Could Happen to You" Experiment

Last night, as Kevin Neece was running movies through the witchcraft
invocation process the four movies were as follows:
My Super Ex-Girlfriend, Valley Girl, Moonstruck, It Could Happen to You.
Three of which star Nicolas Cage.

The next morning, today, Kevin Neece woke up and then it suddenly dawned on
him. If screening movies on his television set during the invocation
process results in the manifestation of fictional movie plots into real
life, based on whether they were based on scientific reality, and It Could
Happen to You was based on a true story, then does that mean that lottery
lighting will strike twice?

And more than that, how is this going to translate into real life? Because
there are multiple alternate options in front of us.

Does this mean that Kevin Neece is going to win the lottery if he plays?

But It Could Happen to You is about a New York Police Officer sharing his
winnings with a Waitress.

Does this mean the Spell effects ANY police officer, or just the ones in
New York?

It's truly puzzling, isn't it? Since Kevin Neece is the spell petitioner,
we are going to have to assume that the Three Fates are going to relate the
spell to him.

Let's see if Kevin Neece can crack Verthandi's Lottery Algorithm through
pure obsessive compulsive gambler logic and crackhead insanity shall we?

Be warned however that Kevin Neece's witchcraft experiments are somewhat
inspired by the Jim Carrey movie Bruce Almighty.

In Bruce Almighty, Jim Carrey clicked the Yes button to everybody's Prayer
Emails and it resulted in the entire city of Los Angeles winning the
lottery at the same time, then they rioted and burned down the city when
they realized that the payout was only $1 because of the prize money being
split between the entire city.

I'm going for the 4/7/2021 draw on Lindsay Ashley Neece's Birthday.
Because who the flying fuck needs $184 Million anyways?

Cash Payout for Lotto Texas is $6 Million.

Officer Robert Cunningham only won $6 Million
then he shared $3 Million with Phyllis Penzo.

Spell Logic states to go for the Lottery Drawing
where the cash payouts are close to $6 Million.

The Numbers played in the Movie are

6 - 12 - 16 - 26 - 64 - 84

My guess however, is that some poor bastard on the New York Police Force
has been playing Robert Cunningham's numbers for decades without luck. It's
just too easy and highly unlikely, but we'll play them anyways.

Note Belldandy is Fictional. The real Belldandy is Verthandi from Voluspa.

First Modern Printing of Voluspa was in 1665 by Peder Hansen Resen

Peder Hansen Resen was born June 17, 1625 - June 1, 1688

06 - 17 - 16 - 25 - 1 - 88

Voluspa first appeared in the Codex Regius written during the 1270s.
Made up of 45 vellum leaves. originally contained further 8 leaves now
missing.
The codex was discovered in 1643

12 - 70 - 45 - 8 - 16 - 43 First Discovery Date

or

12 - 70 - 45 - 8 - 16 - 65 First Modern Printing Date

Snorri's Edda (GKS 2367 4to) is also named Codex Regius.
Composed of 55 vellum pages, dating from the early 14th century.
It was returned to Iceland in 1985.

23 - 67 - 55 - 14 - 19 - 85

19. An ash I know, | Yggdrasil its name,
With water white | is the great tree wet;
Thence come the dews | that fall in the dales,
Green by Urth's well | does it ever grow.

20. Thence come the maidens | mighty in wisdom,
Three from the dwelling | down 'neath the tree;
Urth is one named, | Verthandi the next,--
On the wood they scored,-- | and Skuld the third.
Laws they made there, and life allotted
To the sons of men, and set their fates.

19. Yggdrasil: cf. stanza 2 and note, and Grimnismol, 29-35 and notes. Urth
("The Past"): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by
being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well.

20. The maidens: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza
8. Dwelling: Regius has "s=C3=A6" (sea) instead of "sal" (hall, home), and =
many
editors have followed this reading, although Snorri's prose paraphrase
indicates "sal." Urth, Verthandi and Skuld: "Past," "Present" and "Future."
Wood, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were
cut on pieces of wood. Lines 3-4 are probably interpolations from some
other account of the Norns.]

19 - 2 - 29 - 35 - 20 - 34

Now that we've gathered up all of these numbers, there is just one more to
collect, one that cannot be deciphered through research.

Robert Cunningham came up with three numbers himself, and he got the other
three numbers from Waitress Phyllis Penzo in a pizza parlor.

The Fantasy Relationship presented in the movie is Bullshit. They never
fell in love in real life. They were both happily married and remained
friends.

Once Kevin Neece obtains these secret numbers the game is set and he's
running this experiment through the Burn Sigil Process at 8:00pm tonight.

And we will see if Kevin Neece was able to crack Verthandi's Lottery
Algorithm.

Remember Gods, Goddesses, Police Officers, and Demon Queens, the point of
this experimental game isn't to get rich quick.

It's to see which number the Goddesses of Fate chose to apply the winner to
and decipher the meaning of their intentions.

------------------------
UPDATE: 4/6/2021 3:30pm

So far, all of the following numbers on the list add up to 15 tickets.

When Kevin Neece went to the corner Gas Station, which was also a Pizza
Parlor, he discovered that the numbers on the Lottery Tickets he needed
only went up to the number 54.

Thus, any one of his numbers that went above the number 54 were
automatically disqualified. The first fourteen tickets were rendered
useless. Leaving only one number left.

02 - 19 - 20 - 29 - 34 - 35

This was the number applied to the Voluspa stances revolving around the
Three Norns Verthandi Urth and Skolde.

And the Lotto Texas Extra! drawing is on April 7th, 2021 at 10:00pm

This incident will be taking place on the birthday of his daughter Lindsay
Ashley Neece.

Kevin Neece bought exactly TWO TICKETS for $1 each at a cash value of $6.5
Million, when split between two people it will be close to $3 Million.

Kevin Neece explored the Pizza Parlors of the Austin Area, but his
intuition told him that none of them fit.

Then he realised Robert Cunningham attended Sal's Pizzeria because he had
been coming there for years.

Robert Cunningham did what was right for himself, not what was right for
Kevin Neece.

Kevin Neece instead chose to follow his intuition which brought him to:

Cheddar's Restaurant 2031
4301 William Cannon Dr
Austin, TX 78749-1473

Where he had been taking his Grandmother out to eat for the past ten years
when he cared for her in Assisted Living.

Upon arriving inside, he took a seat at the bar where no one was working
and prayed to the Three Fates that the proper Waitress be presented to him.

At 2:27pm on 04/06/2021, a middle aged waitress named Sondra arrived to
take his order and was amused by his story.

Kevin Neece's theory is that NOTHING happens to him by accident because the
Three Goddesses are always guiding him.

As the Phyllis Penzo had been working as a waitress for 24 years, it would
make sense NOT to give the Lottery Ticket to a young waitress just starting
out, but an older waitress who had been working a dead end career in the
field of restaurants her entire life.

This turned out to be Sondra. That is the only name that Kevin Neece knows
her by.

Just as the movie ordered, the Ticket was given to Sondra in replacement of
a Tip along with the printed out explanation of the Invocation Experiment.
--------------
4/8/2021

On 4/7/2021, the day the Lottery Drawing, Kevin Neece, his mother Debbie
Brand, and his Daughter Lindsay met up for lunch at Poke-e-Joe's Barbeque
to celebrate his daughter's 17th birthday. Kevin Neece considered signing
his ticket under his daughter's name as a gift but realized that she was
too young to collect on a Lottery Ticket.

Later that Night, he added to the experiment. In addition to running a
video photo during the prayer showcasing a blown up image of the Lottery
Ticket into the mirror with Sigils for Hekate and "To Win a Lottery" from
Wolf of Antioch, Kevin Neece decided to test out a little experiment based
on The Last Starfighter, where an Arcade Machine served as a Recruiting
Device for the real Space Fighters.

Kevin Neece's theory, is that because Kosuke Fujishima invoked the Norns
and they clairvoyantly fed him serendipity ideas for his Oh My Goddess
manga, the spells that the Goddesses use in the Manga might be real spells
that are hiding in plain sight that nobody knows how to use. Kevin Neece's
theory is that if you translate these spells into Latin and combine them
with the Infamous Satania Mantra, then maybe they will take on a somewhat
plausible reality effect in real life.

In order to put this to the test, he sampled this Good Fortune spell out of
the Oh My Goddess Omnibus Vol 1 Page 161 where Belldandy is trying to help
Keiichi cheat at winning a race.

"Natz Fehr Ata Infernum Negra... Verthandi Urth and Skolde, Eyan Catya Icar
Hekate, Eko Eko Hekate, Star of Fortune, Goddesses of Fate, Please Grant
Waitress Sondra Power. Please Grant Waitress Sondra Opportunity. Please
Grant Waitress Sondra Luck. Please Grant Waitress Sondra Good Fortune. This
I wish of you and more. 2 - 19 - 20 - 29 - 34 - 35. Stella Fortuna! Dona
Det illi Potestas Eius Potestas Det Ei Fortuna! Amen! 2 - 19 - 20 - 29 - 34
- 35."

From 9pm all the way up to 10pm, the moment of the drawing, Kevin Neece sat
in front of the television set burning incense and repeating this prayer,
while random music played off of his iphone 7 from the Spotify Playlist Bad
Goddess: War Games. During the final moments of the drawing around 10pm,
the song Baltimora's Tarzan Boy began playing which was the theme song to
Marller Gets a Spinoff. After the prayer was done, Kevin Neece left the
room into the kitchen to charge his phone and stood there in suspense
waiting for the winning numbers to be posted on the online Texas Lottery
website.

During the entire time he stood there, Keri Hilson's Knock You Down began
playing which set this extremely fucked up mood of suspense:

Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinking about our life, our house, our kids,
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around
and you knocked me down, knocked me down

Finally the Lottery Results were posted. The numbers were:
2 - 5 - 14 - 19 - 29 - 43

Kevin Neece's experiment not only failed, but adding insult to the injury
only three numbers won:
2 - 19 - 29

Trying to make the best of things, he posted his results online, then tried
to decipher what went wrong during the experiment and whether there were
any usual signs of Irony, Serendipity, or Coincidence surrounding the
event, such as they do whenever he invokes the Three Fates. Kevin Neece
could think of nothing, except that it failed because he wasn't an actual
cop. He attempted to investigate a few environmental/piracy crimes on his
own in the past to file reports to the Austin Police and the FBI and the
CIA in the past, but could never get a response from them, meaning he's
never risen above the level of criminal informant.

Kevin Neece's theory is that the Spell might not really be a failure, it
simply may have been aimed at a real police officer, either in the Austin
Texas or New York area, and it's simply too early to tell because it takes
a few days for News Articles to showcase themselves on Social Media.
Remember, the numbers on Kevin Neece's lottery tickets only went up to 54,
but there are other Lotteries in other States that may have a higher number
range and could have made use of the other numbers rather than the one
choice that Kevin Neece was forced to go with through the process of
elimination.

As he pondered the meaning of his failure, he popped on Rob Reiner's When
Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle for the Goddess Spirits he invoked
as they had subconsciously handpicked the movies for him at Half Price
Books. And then the Ironic Coincidence hit him.

Officer Robert Cunningham offered to split his Lottery Ticket with Phyllis
Penzo as a Tip. He won $6 Million Dollars, thus the prize money was split
two ways, $3 Million for Cunningham and $3 Million for Penzo. In the movie,
Nicolas Cage gets bitched out by his wife because the winning numbers are
on one ticket. Kevin Neece bypassed this problem by buying TWO lottery
tickets with the same number on them: 2 - 19 - 20 - 29 - 34 - 35. One
ticket for him, and one ticket for the Waitress Sondra, who denied an
additional cash tip out of fear that it might jinx Kevin Neece's spell.

The prize payout for Three Numbers on a Lotto Texas Ticket is $3. When the
two tickets Kevin Neece bought are cashed in together, the Prize money adds
up to $6. Officer Robert Cunningham won $6 Million. Kevin Neece won $6.
Cunningham and Penzo split the prize money for $3 Million equally. Kevin
Neece and Waitress Sondra split the prize money for $3 equally.  $6 split
in half into $3 dollars each, and a more appropriate amount for a cash tip
on a meal (although it still falls below the standard 20%).

In addition, the three numbers 2 - 19 - 29 could carry a symbolic meaning.
Three Numbers. Three Goddesses of Fate. Three Sisters, born one decade
apart from each other, who span the domains of Past Present in Future. 2 is
in the Past. 19 is in the Present. 29 is in the Future. However this Logic
defies the traditional meaning of the Norns, where Urdr Goddess of the Past
is the Eldest Sister while Skuld Goddess of the Future is the Youngest. In
Greek Mythology, Hekate's Triple Goddess Persona is showcased within the
order of Maiden, Mother, and Crone, thus showcasing a System of Age that
progressively moves forward with time, not backwards.

Take also into consideration the exact wording of Kevin Neece's Spell
Petition: Star of Fortune, Goddesses of Fate, Please Grant Waitress Sondra
Power, Please Grant Waitress Sondra Opportunity, Please Grant Waitress
Sondra Luck, Please Grant Waitress Sondra Good Fortune. Stop and think
about this for a moment. Do these requests necessarily have to translate
into winning the lottery. What if the Goddesses of Fate chose to interpret
these requests towards the Waitress Sondra in a completely different form
of Divine Intervention, as God has been known to work in very mysterious
ways?

Those are my thoughts for now. As to anybody else who is able to win money
off of these lottery numbers, good luck, but never forget, money buys you
stuff, but it rarely buys you happiness. There's a reason "The Powerball
Curse" expression exists. For it is easier for a camel to pass through the
eye of the needle, than for a Rich Man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. For
God will always favor those who Humble themselves. Good Night.

<div dir=3D"ltr"><div dir=3D"ltr"><div>The &quot;It Could Happen to You&quo=
t; Experiment</div><div><br></div><div>Note for the New York 60th Precinct =
Police. Please humor me for a moment because this next experiment may invol=
ve you. I&#39;ve been performing these bizarre paranormal research experime=
nts recently where I run fictional movies into my bedroom mirror late at ni=
ght during the invocation of Goddess Spirits and Demons and such, and then =
a few days later an incident winds up on Social Media News that ironically =
mirrors the effects of the fictional movie plots I screened. However, in or=
der for this gag to work, the film has to have some kind of basis element t=
hat can be translated into scientific reality.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#=
39;ll try to keep the opening short to bring you up to speed. The Curse of =
Ah My Goddess, the anime show, is when the Three Real Goddesses from Norse =
Mythology are invoked, they showcase themselves by causing a &quot;glitch i=
n the matrix&quot; where stranger than fiction incidents happen surrounded =
by IRONY, SERENDIPITY, or COINCIDENCE, sometimes relating back to the names=
 Verdandi, Urdr, Skolde, Mara, or Norse Mythology in General.</div><div><br=
></div><div>What I have stumbled upon, within the making of a fan film vers=
ion of the Ah My Goddess anime series, is like if a Tales from the Crypt sc=
enario were to happen in real life. The show has developed a spiritual atta=
chment like a Ouija Board Haunting because Kosuke Fujishima named the chara=
cters after real life spiritual deities from a Pagan Witchcraft religion th=
at we all assumed to be a work of fiction. But all of the evidence I&#39;ve=
 seen suggests these Spirits that manipulate Fate are Real, thought they ma=
y be called by different names. The implication is that the Franchise Succe=
ss behind the Ah My Goddess anime in Japan is that Kosuke Fujishima was so =
obsessed with his subject matter, that he accidentally invoked the Real God=
desses, and they interpreted his Manga Series as a Sacrificial Offering to =
them in the form of publicity for their Goddesses and their Religion so the=
y rewarded his series with extreme Good Fortune, and now their images are F=
ranchise plastered all over Japan Pop Culture everywhere like Mickey Mouse,=
 unaware to Kodansha Ltd that what they&#39;ve basically done is they&#39;v=
e accidentally created a brand new form of False Idolatry for the Goddesses=
 because all of their fans who find out they have a basis in reality wishfu=
lly believe that the real Goddesses in the Afterlife are the ones they&#39;=
ve fallen in love with from the Television Show. But they&#39;re not. In re=
al life, those Goddesses are responsible for the Birth, Life, and Deaths of=
 everyone on Planet Earth including everyone reading this email. And that g=
ives them an unexpected Dark Side that nobody appears to be taking seriousl=
y except Kevin Neece himself.</div><div><br></div><div>One night during an =
Spirit Invocation, Kevin Neece screened Gone With the Wind, then he said ou=
t loud that the reason he did this was because Kodansha Ltd was about to be=
come &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; due to a curse he had placed on their C=
ompany CEO for refusing to respond to him about the matter for four years a=
nd putting him on an industry blacklist. When the movie was over, it was an=
nounced online that a 7.6 Earthquake hit Miyagi Prefecture in Japan.</div><=
div><br></div><div><a href=3D"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japan-earthquake=
-shaking-buildings-even-in-tokyo/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japan-earth=
quake-shaking-buildings-even-in-tokyo/</a></div><div><br></div><div>I then =
got the most twisted unbelievable idea ever. This was jokingly inspired by =
a Sean Connery villain from the 1998 Avengers movie with Uma Thurman and Ra=
lph Fiennes. In the movie, Sean Connery plays Sir Augustus DeWynter, who ta=
kes the world hostage by staging a bunch of terrorist attacks in the form o=
f Natural Disaster events using a machine that can control the weather.</di=
v><div><br></div><div>Starting near the end of March 20th 2021:</div><div><=
br></div><div>For the first experiment, this immediate thought came to mind=
. If I were to screen Dante&#39;s Peak and Tommy Lee Jones Volcano, does th=
at mean that a dormant volcano would erupt? That&#39;s exactly what I did. =
And during the movie, I jokingly dared them to do it over and over again. T=
he next morning, it was announced on the News that a 6,000 year old dormant=
 volcano erupted in Iceland, which is where Norse Mythology originates from=
.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=3D"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iceland-=
volcano-fagradals-mountain-eruption-dormant-for-6000-years/">https://www.cb=
snews.com/news/iceland-volcano-fagradals-mountain-eruption-dormant-for-6000=
-years/</a></div><div><br></div><div>Taking the experiment even further, on=
 the next night I screened Jan De Bont&#39;s Twister, daring them to touch =
down several F5 tornadoes within the next 48 hours. The next day, it looked=
 like everything was calm and nothing on the horizon, with only a slight 30=
% on a Wednesday. Within 48 hours the dynamic drastically changed and it wa=
s reported that multiple F4 and F5 tornadoes touched down in the Mississipp=
i areas.</div><div><br></div><div><a href=3D"https://abcnews.go.com/US/stor=
m-produce-tornadoes-south-weekend/story?id=3D76700550">https://abcnews.go.c=
om/US/storm-produce-tornadoes-south-weekend/story?id=3D76700550</a></div><d=
iv><br></div><div>As Police Officers, I would have you all take note that a=
ll of these Natural Disaster Events are happening within days of each other=
 near the end of March. It&#39;s because I screened the Disaster movies wit=
hin days of each other during that time period.</div><div><br></div><div>I =
also screened Wolfgang Peterson&#39;s The Perfect Storm and Poseidon Advent=
ure remake that night. I believe the reason the Perfect Storm test failed i=
s because I requested a recreation of the events on location unaware that t=
he incident took place in October, thus being called &quot;The Halloween St=
orm&quot;. The Poseidon Adventure cruise ship capsize failed to hit it&#39;=
s 48 hour mark as well but on April 4, 2021 it was reported that a Cruise S=
hip capsized in China, which falls within a week or so of the screening.</d=
iv><div><br></div><div><a href=3D"https://newstalk941.com/hundreds-missing-=
after-china-cruise-ship-capsizes/">https://newstalk941.com/hundreds-missing=
-after-china-cruise-ship-capsizes/</a></div><div><br></div><div>The next da=
y or so, I went for the ridiculous one. I screened Michael Bay&#39;s Armage=
ddon and Deep Impact, my curse victim was Vladimir Putin, and I was trying =
to dare the Goddesses to smash Russia with a Meteor. While this incident di=
d not happen, it isn&#39;t as stupid as you think it is. After checking onl=
ine, I discovered that two days earlier a Meteor large enough to destroy a =
whole country just passed by Planet Earth missing it, and in 2013, Russia w=
as hit by a meteor that killed and injured nearly 1,000 people. I had the r=
ight idea, I just missed the mark by a few days.</div><div><br></div><div><=

st-the-earth/">https://www.cnet.com/news/huge-asteroid-2021-eq3-zoomed-safe=
ly-past-the-earth/</a></div><div><br></div><div>Next on the disaster list w=
as an experiment in Fate where I screened the Dwayne Johnson movies San And=
reas and Skyscraper to see if Fate could be manipulated to put Dwayne Johns=
on through the motions of real life similar events to what was in the movie=
, only being played out in real life back to back in one week. Basically Dw=
ayne Johnson is Fate&#39;s Guinea Pig.This experiment was run around March =
28, 2021 and this was reported on April 5th. Dwayne Johnson&#39;s whereabou=
ts during the incident are still unknown to me. If he was halfway around th=
e world shooting a movie at the time the incident happend then the experime=
nt kind of failed to be honest even though an earthquake did happen. It was=
n&#39;t THE BIG ONE because the San Andreas movie is over the top Hollywood=
 Green Screen bullshit that does not match up to Reality.</div><div><br></d=
iv><div><a href=3D"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/05/us/earthquake-california-=
los-angeles/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/05/us/earthquake-califo=
rnia-los-angeles/index.html</a></div><div><br></div><div>The final test inv=
olving War Games, Watchmen Ultimate Cut, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Rol=
and Emmerich&#39;s The Day after Tomorrow and 2012 were specifically curse =
aimed at the countries threatening the United States with Nuclear War, CHIN=
A, RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA, with no set due date other than a few warning signs=
 for the CIA and the Pentagon to watch out for. The idea is inspired by the=
 movie Watchmen. The reason the United States is afraid to attack these cou=
ntries in pre-emptive self defense is because they will launch their missil=
es in retaliation. But what if these countries Nuclear Weapons were disarme=
d by Hackers leaving them defenseless, and then they were wiped out by a Na=
tural Disaster Act of God, unaware that it was secretly an attack by someon=
e playing &quot;God in the Machine&quot; in the United States, such as the =
Earthquake in Roland Emmerich&#39;s 2012. It&#39;s exactly like the end of =
the movie Watchmen. Ozymandias harnessed the Destructive Power of the Gods =
launching an attack that wiped out millions, but it was done in the service=
 of deterring and preventing a Nuclear War standoff that would have killed =
billions. Ozymandias &quot;practical joke&quot; was a blood sacrifice inten=
ded to prevent the total destruction of Planet Earth. Mankind&#39;s punishm=
ent for flirting with the possibility of Nuclear War like it was a North Ko=
rean Dick Measuring Contest. Kevin Neece is Ozymandias, and the Three Godde=
sses of Fate and their &quot;Natural Disaster Acts of God&quot; represent D=
octor Manhattan. The Pirate Captain&#39;s Quest in Tales of the Black Freig=
hter represents the damnation of Kevin Neece&#39;s soul as these experiment=
s have resulted in him being spirit wife married to an unknown Succubus Dem=
on, with the side effect that he can now invoke these dangerous entities wi=
thout suffering from any kind of misfortune backlash side effects..</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>Moving on however, we now come to the 60th Precinct of Ne=
w York City, which is where I&#39;m told Officer Robert Cunningham used to =
work during the 1985 Lottery Winning Incident that inspired Nicolas Cage&#3=
9;s &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;. Once again, in order for these spel=
ls to work, there has to be a basis in reality, so using a film that was ba=
sed on a true story makes sense in this paranormal experiment.</div><div><b=

4/6/2021 3:30pm</div><div><br></div><div>So far, all of the following numbe=
rs on the list add up to 15 tickets.</div><div><br></div><div>When Kevin Ne=
ece went to the corner Gas Station, which was also a Pizza Parlor, he disco=
vered that the numbers on the Lottery Tickets he needed only went up to the=
 number 54.</div><div><br></div><div>Thus, any one of his numbers that went=
 above the number 54 were automatically disqualified. The first fourteen ti=
ckets were rendered useless. Leaving only one number left.</div><div><br></=
div><div>02 - 19 - 20 - 29 - 34 - 35</div><div><br></div><div>This was the =
number applied to the Voluspa stances revolving around the Three Norns Vert=
handi Urth and Skolde.</div><div><br></div><div>And the Lotto Texas Extra! =
drawing is on April 7th, 2021 at 10:00pm</div><div><br></div><div>This inci=
dent will be taking place on the birthday of his daughter Lindsay Ashley Ne=
ece.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece bought exactly TWO TICKETS for $1=
 each at a cash value of $6.5 Million, when split between two people it wil=
l be close to $3 Million.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece explored the=
 Pizza Parlors of the Austin Area, but his intuition told him that none of =
them fit.</div><div><br></div><div>Then he realised Robert Cunningham atten=
ded Sal&#39;s Pizzeria because he had been coming there for years.</div><di=
v><br></div><div>Robert Cunningham did what was right for himself, not what=
 was right for Kevin Neece.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece instead ch=
ose to follow his intuition which brought him to:</div><div><br></div><div>=
Cheddar&#39;s Restaurant 2031</div><div>4301 William Cannon Dr</div><div>Au=
stin, TX 78749-1473</div><div><br></div><div>Where he had been taking his G=
randmother out to eat for the past ten years when he cared for her in Assis=
ted Living.</div><div><br></div><div>Upon arriving inside, he took a seat a=
t the bar where no one was working and prayed to the Three Fates that the p=
roper Waitress be presented to him.</div><div><br></div><div>At 2:27pm on 0=
4/06/2021, a middle aged waitress named Sondra arrived to take his order an=
d was amused by his story.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece&#39;s theor=
y is that NOTHING happens to him by accident because the Three Goddesses ar=
e always guiding him.</div><div><br></div><div>As the Phyllis Penzo had bee=
n working as a waitress for 24 years, it would make sense NOT to give the L=
ottery Ticket to a young waitress just starting out, but an older waitress =
who had been working a dead end career in the field of restaurants her enti=
re life.</div><div><br></div><div>This turned out to be Sondra. That is the=
 only name that Kevin Neece knows her by.</div><div><br></div><div>Just as =
the movie ordered, the Ticket was given to Sondra in replacement of a Tip a=
long with the printed out explanation of the Invocation Experiment.</div><d=
iv>--------------</div><div>4/8/2021</div><div><br></div><div>On 4/7/2021, =
the day the Lottery Drawing, Kevin Neece, his mother Debbie Brand, and his =
Daughter Lindsay met up for lunch at Poke-e-Joe&#39;s Barbeque to celebrate=
 his daughter&#39;s 17th birthday. Kevin Neece considered signing his ticke=
t under his daughter&#39;s name as a gift but realized that she was too you=
ng to collect on a Lottery Ticket.</div><div><br></div><div>Later that Nigh=
t, he added to the experiment. In addition to running a video photo during =
the prayer showcasing a blown up image of the Lottery Ticket into the mirro=
r with Sigils for Hekate and &quot;To Win a Lottery&quot; from Wolf of Anti=
och, Kevin Neece decided to test out a little experiment based on The Last =
Starfighter, where an Arcade Machine served as a Recruiting Device for the =
real Space Fighters.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece&#39;s theory, is =
that because Kosuke Fujishima invoked the Norns and they clairvoyantly fed =
him serendipity ideas for his Oh My Goddess manga, the spells that the Godd=
esses use in the Manga might be real spells that are hiding in plain sight =
that nobody knows how to use. Kevin Neece&#39;s theory is that if you trans=
late these spells into Latin and combine them with the Infamous Satania Man=
tra, then maybe they will take on a somewhat plausible reality effect in re=
al life.</div><div><br></div><div>In order to put this to the test, he samp=
led this Good Fortune spell out of the Oh My Goddess Omnibus Vol 1 Page 161=
 where Belldandy is trying to help Keiichi cheat at winning a race.</div><d=

y up to 10pm, the moment of the drawing, Kevin Neece sat in front of the te=
levision set burning incense and repeating this prayer, while random music =
played off of his iphone 7 from the Spotify Playlist Bad Goddess: War Games=
. During the final moments of the drawing around 10pm, the song Baltimora&#=
39;s Tarzan Boy began playing which was the theme song to Marller Gets a Sp=
inoff. After the prayer was done, Kevin Neece left the room into the kitche=
n to charge his phone and stood there in suspense waiting for the winning n=
umbers to be posted on the online Texas Lottery website.</div><div><br></di=
v><div>During the entire time he stood there, Keri Hilson&#39;s Knock You D=

v><div>2 - 5 - 14 - 19 - 29 - 43</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece&#39;s=
 experiment not only failed, but adding insult to the injury only three num=
bers won:</div><div>2 - 19 - 29</div><div><br></div><div>Trying to make the=
 best of things, he posted his results online, then tried to decipher what =
went wrong during the experiment and whether there were any usual signs of =
Irony, Serendipity, or Coincidence surrounding the event, such as they do w=
henever he invokes the Three Fates. Kevin Neece could think of nothing, exc=
ept that it failed because he wasn&#39;t an actual cop. He attempted to inv=
estigate a few environmental/piracy crimes on his own in the past to file r=
eports to the Austin Police and the FBI and the CIA in the past, but could =
never get a response from them, meaning he&#39;s never risen above the leve=
l of criminal informant.</div><div><br></div><div>Kevin Neece&#39;s theory =
is that the Spell might not really be a failure, it simply may have been ai=
med at a real police officer, either in the Austin Texas or New York area, =
and it&#39;s simply too early to tell because it takes a few days for News =
Articles to showcase themselves on Social Media. Remember, the numbers on K=
evin Neece&#39;s lottery tickets only went up to 54, but there are other Lo=
tteries in other States that may have a higher number range and could have =
made use of the other numbers rather than the one choice that Kevin Neece w=
as forced to go with through the process of elimination.</div><div><br></di=
v><div>As he pondered the meaning of his failure, he popped on Rob Reiner&#=
39;s When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle for the Goddess Spirits =
he invoked as they had subconsciously handpicked the movies for him at Half=
 Price Books. And then the Ironic Coincidence hit him.</div><div><br></div>=
<div>Officer Robert Cunningham offered to split his Lottery Ticket with Phy=
llis Penzo as a Tip. He won $6 Million Dollars, thus the prize money was sp=
lit two ways, $3 Million for Cunningham and $3 Million for Penzo. In the mo=
vie, Nicolas Cage gets bitched out by his wife because the winning numbers =
are on one ticket. Kevin Neece bypassed this problem by buying TWO lottery =
tickets with the same number on them: 2 - 19 - 20 - 29 - 34 - 35. One ticke=
t for him, and one ticket for the Waitress Sondra, who denied an additional=
 cash tip out of fear that it might jinx Kevin Neece&#39;s spell.</div><div=
><br></div><div>The prize payout for Three Numbers on a Lotto Texas Ticket =
is $3. When the two tickets Kevin Neece bought are cashed in together, the =
Prize money adds up to $6. Officer Robert Cunningham won $6 Million. Kevin =
Neece won $6. Cunningham and Penzo split the prize money for $3 Million equ=
ally. Kevin Neece and Waitress Sondra split the prize money for $3 equally.=
=C2=A0 $6 split in half into $3 dollars each, and a more appropriate amount=
 for a cash tip on a meal (although it still falls below the standard 20%).=
</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, the three numbers 2 - 19 - 29 could =
carry a symbolic meaning. Three Numbers. Three Goddesses of Fate. Three Sis=
ters, born one decade apart from each other, who span the domains of Past P=
resent in Future. 2 is in the Past. 19 is in the Present. 29 is in the Futu=
re. However this Logic defies the traditional meaning of the Norns, where U=
rdr Goddess of the Past is the Eldest Sister while Skuld Goddess of the Fut=
ure is the Youngest. In Greek Mythology, Hekate&#39;s Triple Goddess Person=
a is showcased within the order of Maiden, Mother, and Crone, thus showcasi=
ng a System of Age that progressively moves forward with time, not backward=
s.</div><div><br></div><div>Take also into consideration the exact wording =
of Kevin Neece&#39;s Spell Petition: Star of Fortune, Goddesses of Fate, Pl=
ease Grant Waitress Sondra Power, Please Grant Waitress Sondra Opportunity,=
 Please Grant Waitress Sondra Luck, Please Grant Waitress Sondra Good Fortu=
ne. Stop and think about this for a moment. Do these requests necessarily h=
ave to translate into winning the lottery. What if the Goddesses of Fate ch=
ose to interpret these requests towards the Waitress Sondra in a completely=
 different form of Divine Intervention, as God has been known to work in ve=
ry mysterious ways?</div><div><br></div><div>Those are my thoughts for now.=
 As to anybody else who is able to win money off of these lottery numbers, =
good luck, but never forget, money buys you stuff, but it rarely buys you h=
appiness. There&#39;s a reason &quot;The Powerball Curse&quot; expression e=
xists. For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle, =
than for a Rich Man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. For God will always fav=
or those who Humble themselves. Good Night.</div><div><br></div><div>--</di=
