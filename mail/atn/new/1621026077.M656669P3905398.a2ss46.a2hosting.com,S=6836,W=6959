Hei,

 My name is Josh and I'm a Canadian author, game designer, and editor. My
friend and co-editor Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad, founder of the Islamic
Science Fiction project, and I have recently curated a collection of
historical fiction that explores the fascinating connections between
Vikings and Muslims at the height of the Viking Age titled 'Althingi: The
Crescent & the Northern Star'. Particularly in Canada and the US there are
many false narratives about Vikings that are propagated by (and that
support) white supremcist histories which are harmful in so many ways. We
hope to challenge these falsities through this project and better inform
our readers which seems to align well with Awaken the North's mission.

 We have already crowd-funded almost $10 000 to bring this project to life
and are very close to meeting our goal. If you think that members of Awaken
the North might be interested in challenging white supremicist narratives
by supporting this project and learning more about this under-examined
topic in history, please consider sharing it
<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330509990/althingi-the-crescent-and-the-northern-star>.
Knowledge is power! We recently did a podcast interview with John Hijatt
from Gifts of the Wyrd podcast
<https://giftsofthewyrd.podbean.com/e/althingi/>if you are interested in
hearing more about the project.

 Thank you so much for your time!

 Takk!

 -Josh
