("Knowest thou counsel for this case?""So it seems," says he. "Put forth thy counsel!" said they. "It)Tj

T*
(to speak a certain young man; he had a shock head of red hair, and was freckled of face and right grim)Tj
T*
(of look, and he called out, "Men are mighty badly off for counsel here," says he. The king’s)Tj
T*
(counsellors asked him what counsel he saw for the matter. He answered, "This is my counsel, that)Tj
T*
(every man that is come here lay down so much silver as the king shall say, and when that money is got)Tj
T*
(together in one place, then they shall be paid out of it who have suffered this harm, and that which)Tj

(remains over the king shall take to himself for his fee, and I know he will be well pleased with his)Tj

(share; and men will lie here no longer as though they were weather-bound, to their great hinderance,)Tj
T*
(such a crowd as have come together here. "This was quickly taken up by the whole people, and they)Tj
T*
(said they would sooner lay out their money in feeing the king than sit there to their hinderance. And)Tj
T*
(this counsel was taken, and the money was got together; and it was a great sum. And straightaway)Tj
T*
(upon this a great many of the ships sailed abroad. Then the king held a moot, and there they looked)Tj
T*
(through that great sum of money, and the brothers were paid for their loss out of it. Then the king)Tj
T*
(talked with his men of what was to be done with this great sum. Then a man got up to speak, and said,)Tj
T*
("My lord, what think ye he deserves that gave the counsel?"Then they looked about to find the young)Tj
T*
(man who had given the counsel in this matter, and there he was before the king. Then spake King)Tj
T*
(Harold, "This money shall be dealt into two halves; my men shall have one half, and the other half I)Tj
T*
(shall deal into two lots, and this young man shall have one lot, and I will look after the other. "Thrond)Tj
T*
(thanked the king with fair words and blithe. And it was such a great sum of money that Thrond got)Tj
T*
(that it was hard work to tell it out into marks. Then King Harold sailed away, and all the multitude of)Tj
T*
(men that had been there also. Thrond fared to Norway with the merchants that had come thither with)Tj
T*
(him, and they paid him the money he had asked for; and he bought him there a merchant ship both big)Tj
T*
(and good, and loaded it with the great goods that he had gotten on that voyage. Then he held on his)Tj
T*
(course in this ship to the Færeys, and came thither with all his goods safe and sound. And he took up)Tj
T*
(his dwelling in Gate the spring after; and he felt no lack of chattels now. Thrond was a big man of)Tj
T*
(growth, and red-haired he was, and red-bearded, freckled and grim of look, gloomy of mind, cunning)Tj
