(Thórðr hight a man, who was the son of Hörða-Kári, a man of great reputation; he was chief over the)Tj
0 -1.2 TD
(counties which lay next to his. He was Lord by title, but superior to Earls in many things. He had a)Tj
T*
(noble wife, by whom he had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son was called Steingrímrr, the)Tj
T*
(second Klyppr, the third Eyjúlfr, and the daughter Sigríðr. All the bairns were promising, but Klyppr)Tj
T*
(was the foremost of his brothers. They were all mighty men, wonderfully fine and strong fellows, as)Tj
T*
(their forefathers had been. Their sister Sigríðr was the finest of women, dressy and high-minded. She)Tj
T*
(was more skilful than any of her mates that grew up with her. When the brothers were nearly of age,)Tj
T*
(their father took illness and died, and his burial was magnificent according to ancient custom. And)Tj
T*
(when the funeral feast was over \(drunk\), the wife of Thórðr gave birth to a fine boy; to him a name)Tj
T*
(was given, and, according to the wife’s wishes, was called Thórðr after his father, as she thought he)Tj
T*
(would become a great man, if he was like his kinsmen. And when Thórðr grew up, he was mighty and)Tj
T*
(strong, promising, hard and furious against all whom he thought little of, but friendly towards the)Tj
T*
(people; he was munificent with his money, gentle of conversation, and a steadfast friend; he was a)Tj
T*
(great jovial man, the most nimble at sports, could swim better than any one, and was a good poet At)Tj
T*
(the time when this happened, the sons of Gunnhildr reigned over Norway; and when Thórðr grew up,)Tj
T*
(he wished to become one of the men of King Gamli, the son of Gunnhildr, who of all men was the)Tj
T*
(most beloved King of Norway, with the exception of Hákon Aðalsteinsfóstri. Thórðr was twelve years)Tj
T*
(of age when he went to the Court of King Gamli, and the King considered him a great man in)Tj
T*
(everything he had to do; and he was with the King for three winters. He always went before the King)Tj
T*
(in every danger and peril, when the King was engaged in warfare, wherefore he received great honour)Tj
T*
(and fame, for which he was widely known. When Thórðr had stayed three winters with King Gamli,)Tj
T*
(he said to the King that he wished to seek his possessions. The King replied: "You have given us good)Tj
T*
(assistance, and you will become a great man." The King unfastened his sword \(sabre\), which he was)Tj
T*
(wont to carry daily, and said to Thórðr, "Here is a sword, which I wish to give to you, and I think good)Tj
T*
(luck will attend it, and with it shall my friendship follow." Thórðr thanked him for this honour and)Tj
T*
(everything else which he had shown him. The King said: "This I beg of you, that you give it to no one,)Tj
T*
(and never part with it, except you have to redeem your own head; and it is not unlikely that you will)Tj
T*
(want to do that." Then Thórðr answers: "I intend, my Lord, not to stay for a long time away from you,)Tj
T*
(while I have the chance to accompany you." The King replies: "That will not be so; for we shall never)Tj
T*
(see one another, now that we part." Thórðr became silent at the King’s words, and answered nought;)Tj
T*
(then he took leave of the King, went home to his possessions, and his relatives were glad to see him.)Tj
T*
(Klyppr, his brother, had taken possession of all their property, and had become a chief over all the)Tj
T*
(counties over which his father had ruled; he was also a Lord by title. But short time after Thórðr went)Tj
T*

0 -1.2 TD
(my brothers, rather than endure this any longer without any revenge, however it may fare." Then)Tj
T*
(answers Klyppr: "True it is, brother, what thou sayest, that it was fully necessary to revenge this)Tj
T*
(disgrace, if an opportunity should offer; and I am heartily willing to take revenge upon him for the)Tj
T*
(insult." After this interview, all the brothers betake themselves from home with a large troop of men in)Tj
T*
(the direction of the Uplands, where they heard that King Sigurðr was at a banquet. And when they)Tj
T*
(arrive at the house in which the King was present and sat at table, the brothers arrange their men for)Tj
T*
(entering, and Thórðr said that the man who was the last to enter should be the first to go out. Klyppr)Tj
T*
(was to be the first to enter, next to him Thórðr, then Steingrímrr, then Eyjúlfr, and then the others)Tj
T*
(according to arrangement. They were all fully armed with helms, shields, and drawn swords. And)Tj
T*
(when Lord Klyppr came before King Sigurðr, he drew his sword and struck the King on the head, and)Tj
T*
(split it open right down to the shoulders; the King then fell dead on to the table. After this the brothers)Tj
T*
(retire farther out into the hall, and in the same moment Thórðr heard a crash behind him, and observed)Tj
T*
(that his brother Klyppr had been struck a death-blow. The man who did this was called Hróaldr, the)Tj
T*
(son of Ögmundr, the son of Hörda-Kári; he was a near relative of the sons of Thórðr; he was waiting at)Tj
T*
(the King’s table when they entered, wherefore they did not notice him; another man did he kill, who)Tj
T*
(was hight Ögmundr, and he was the son of ValÞjófr; and when Thórðr observes the fall of his brother,)Tj
T*
(he struck at Hróaldr and split him asunder above the hips. Then the men sprang up all about the hall,)Tj
T*
(drew their swords, and attacked the brothers furiously, but they defended themselves well and manly.)Tj
T*
(Thórðr made good use of the sword which King Gamli had presented him with, and became slayer of)Tj
T*
(many before he could get out. It came to pass here as it always does, that, when one suddenly loses his)Tj
T*
(chief, most of the men become disorderly, when they should follow their enemies, and so it was here,)Tj
T*
(and the brothers returned to their homes. King Haraldr quickly heard this news -- the fall of his)Tj
T*
(brother, King Sigurðr -- and intends to send men against the brothers for the purpose of killing them.)Tj
T*
(At that time the King was north in the land, wherefore it took longer time than otherwise would have)Tj
T*
(been the case; he summoned "Þing," and had the brothers outlawed from the whole of Norway, but)Tj
T*
(took possession of their property.)Tj

(Now there is to be said, that the brothers came home and related the fall of King Sigurðr and their)Tj
T*
(brother Klyppr. It now seemed to the brothers that they would not be able to remain in the land on)Tj
T*
(account of the power of King Haraldr and Gunnhildr. Their kinsmen and friends then wished to sell)Tj
T*
(their estates for ready money, and added that Thórðr should go in search for Iceland, whither many)Tj
T*
(noble men had gone, who had to flee from the country before the Kings of Norway. Then Thórðr)Tj
T*
(answers: "Not had I intended to flee from my property \(go in exile\), but as there are many noble men,)Tj
T*
(who have been content with settling in Iceland, then it may be that something similar may be my fate.")Tj
T*
(After this Thórðr made himself ready for a journey to Iceland, and with him his brothers Steingrímrr)Tj
T*

T*

T*
(and I fancy therefore, it is more likely that I should show him a little deference." Eyjulfr said: "That)Tj

T*
(will receive no chapman to sit by his side this winter, then let him keep his pride to himself as long as)Tj
T*

(Eyjulfr did, but betook himself to Torfastaðir, for there he possessed another farm; but Thórðr took the)Tj

T*
(youth will be of much use, and he will save my life. But therefore did I bring Thorkell last, thinking he)Tj

(which he intended to send to the Strands for fish, and he was going with the boat himself. Ormr came)Tj

(for three successive days to Ós, and then Thórðr spoke to him, saying: "I request you, Ormr, not to)Tj
T*
(frequent your visits hither to my dislike or to my sister’s disgrace." To this Ormr gave a crossgrained)Tj
T*
(answer, saying, that hitherto he had taken his own counsel as to his joumeyings despite of any man;)Tj
T*
(and said he rather thought that so this time too the matter would have to stand. Thórðr said that they)Tj
T*
(would not be likely both to stand upright, if he came there for the fourth time. Ormr left off his visits)Tj
T*
(for several nights. Now Thórðr went on busying himself about his boat, and, when he had done, one)Tj
T*
(morning, as the weather was fine, he proposed to have sail out of the river. At Ós, one of the)Tj
T*
(handmaids, going into the house, said that now the weather was good for the washing of linen. Now)Tj
T*
(Sigríðr was wont to wash her linen in the rivulet that passed the enclosure of Ós, and now took her)Tj
T*
(linen there in company with the handmaid. This morning Ormr had an inkling of Thórðr’s intention to)Tj
T*
(sail away, and bade his horse be fetched without Skeggi’s knowledge; whereupon he took his weapons)Tj
T*
(and rode to Ós, and went to the very dean where Sigríðr was. He got off his horse and tied it up, laid)Tj
T*
(aside his weapons, and went to Sigríðr, setting her down beside him, laying his head in her lap, and)Tj
T*
(putting her hands round his head. She asked how he could take into his head to do such a thing as)Tj
T*
(this?" For this is altogether against my will; or mindest thou not the last words of threats of my)Tj
T*
(brother’s, which he will be only too sure to keep, so you had better see to your affairs." He answers: "I)Tj
T*
(am not going to be frightened at your wraiths." Now, when Ormr came into the dean, the handmaiden)Tj
T*
(started off down to the ferry, and told Thórðr that Ormr had come to Sigríðr in the dean. Thórðr)Tj
T*
(bestirred himself quickly, and took his sword and his shield, and ran up to the dean, where Ormr still)Tj
T*
(lay in the lap of Sigríðr. Thórðr sprang at Ormr, and said: "Stand up, thou, and defend thyself; that is a)Tj
T*
(manlier deed than to crouch up to women, and to sneak behind me." Ormr started up and stretched for)Tj
T*
(his sword, and in the same moment Thórðr hewed at Ormr, and through his right arm. Then Ormr)Tj
T*
(drew his sword, and, as he started about, his right leg broke, whereupon Thórðr hewed the head of)Tj
T*
(Ormr, and went home to Ós, and there declared the manslaughter to have been done by his hand.)Tj
T*
(Sigríðr bade her brother Thórðr save himself. He smiled at her word and said: "I shall go nowhere)Tj
T*
(away, for I know no roads whereby to go; I shall send a messenger to Reykir, to tell Skeggi of the)Tj
T*

T*
(speedily come here with many men to revenge his brother, and, stalwarth as thou art, thou hast no)Tj
T*
(might to withstand him in such a strife." Thórðr said that he did not care for that. Thereupon he found)Tj
T*
(his shepherd, and bade him go to Reykir and tell Skeggi of the manslaughter. He said he was unwilling)Tj
T*
(to do so, but that he would go if he wished it. "Tell Skeggi also that he must have his fool removed.")Tj
T*
(The youth went as he was ordered, and told Skeggi of the manslaughter of Ormr, his kinsman. Skeggi)Tj
T*

T*
(men with him; he halted near the farm of Viðvik in a small dale called Garðshvammr. Early in the)Tj
T*
(morning after Yule, Thórðr bade his men prepare themselves for returning home, and said, that many)Tj
T*
(things had passed before him during the night. Goodman Kálfr asked, what he had dreamt. "I dreamt,")Tj
T*
(he says, "that we comrades were riding up Hjaltadalr; and when we came nigh Viðvik, there sprang up)Tj
T*
(before us eighteen wolves; one of them was the biggest and ran at me with open mouth, and attacked)Tj
T*
(me and my men; methought they bit my men to death, but I thought that I killed many of the wolves,)Tj
T*
(and the biggest one I thought I wounded, and then I woke." Farmer Kálfr thought this signified)Tj
T*
(hostilities, and said: "This means evil-minded men," and bade him stay the day over, and let spies go)Tj
T*
(down to Viðvik. Thórðr would not. "Then I will," said Kálfr, "give you some more men to increase)Tj
T*
(your company.’" Thórðr said: "Never shall it get abroad that Thórðr ’Terror’ is frightened at mere)Tj
T*
(dreams and increases his company because that he, for this reason, dare not go through the county.")Tj
T*
(They now rode from Kálfstaðir, seven altogether, Thórðr and Thórhallr and five men-servants. The)Tj
T*
(farmer Kálfr gave Thórðr one of his house-carls for accompanying him; his name was Hallr, and a)Tj
T*
(strong man he was. Eyvindr hight a man, who lived at Ás in Hjaltadalr; he had been at Kálfstaðir)Tj

T*

T*
(and Steingrímrr, were of the company. It was said that he intended to ride up along the Borgarfjörðr on)Tj
T*

T*

T*
(towards Viðidalr. A man went with Skeggi, hight Thorbjörn, and was called the Paltry; he lived on)Tj

T*
(that he grudged using his wealth himself or giving it to others, and for this reason he was called "the)Tj

T*
(the house of a man named Thorbjörn, and who was called the Puny. He was the client of Thórðr the)Tj
T*
(Terror, and had gone with him; he possessed a quantity of live-stock of all kinds; he lived on the)Tj
T*
(northern part of Miðfjarðarnes, and his sheep went self-feeding about the woods. Thórðr had as much)Tj
T*
(of his money as he wished for. Eiðr dwelt there for a few nights, and then he rode home to Ós, and)Tj
T*
(ascertained what was going on. He collected some men and rode with fourteen men south on to the)Tj

(heath after his father. Now there is to be said that Thórðr was at the market as long as he wanted, and)Tj
T*
(when he was ready, he rode up the Borgarfjörðr, and north on to the heath so far, that he could see the)Tj

T*
(think most likely Skeggi." Thórðr said: "Long do they persevere lying in wait for me, but although)Tj
T*
(there is a vast difference in strength, yet they shall find resistance." They then rode against them with)Tj
T*
(drawn swords. Skeggi then started up and said: "Ásbjörn, my kinsman, let us now attack them, and let)Tj
T*
(them feel the superiority of our power, and avenge now your brother, Ormr." "So it shall be," says)Tj

T*
(both fell down dead. The third he struck on the neck with the sword in such a manner that the head)Tj

(Steingrímrr fought very boldly and killed four men. The fighting now changed thus, that Steingrímrr)Tj

T*
(after him with nine men. They met up by Krdksmelar. Skeggi asked Eiðr where he intended going.)Tj

(Eiðr says: "I was minded to fill your flock, my father." Says Skeggi: "Your intention is good, my)Tj

T*
(are seeking my life; I shall therefore leave home to-day, and cast about for some catch or another, if an)Tj

T*
(Ásbjörn spoke to his men and said: "There goes Thórðr the Terror, and seems unruly, and I suppose he)Tj
T*
(wants me; let us therefore turn up on the hill and wait there." They did so. Now Thórðr approached)Tj
T*
(and commenced fighting at once; both fought most vigorously, for there was no difference in strength.)Tj
T*
(Thórðr became quickly a man-slayer. Three men fell there of Ásbjorn’s men, but one of Thórðr’s.)Tj
T*
(Then Thórðr attacked Ásbjörn and inflicted several wounds upon him, and he was nearly unfit for)Tj
T*

T*
("Why do you not flee, poor fellow?" Ásbjörn sat himself down, for he was much exhausted because of)Tj
T*
(the loss of blood. Skeggi hewed at Thórðr and hit him in the shoulder, inflicting on him a yawning)Tj
T*
(wound. At the nick of time Eiðr came there with nine men; he ran at once between them, and said that)Tj
T*
(they should not fight any longer: he said also that he should kill Ásbjörn, except that he alone was)Tj
T*
(given permission to settle affairs. Ásbjörn said: "My errand to the country was, to fetch my betrothed;)Tj
T*
(but when I heard of my brother’s slaughter, I made the resolution to avenge him; but our fighting has)Tj
T*
(become such, that I prefer peace with Thórðr." Thórðr answered: "I will grant my foster-son the)Tj
T*
(honour of settling this case, but otherwise I do not care for any peace. The play might go on in the)Tj
T*
(same way as it has gone before." The result, however, was, that they came to terms, and Eiðr was to)Tj
T*
(decide as to all their charges and manslaughters. Thórðr, Asbjörn, and Skeggi all of them joined hands.)Tj

(Thórðr’s hand swelled. Eiðr cut from the wound the flesh where the edge of the sword had touched.)Tj

(disgrace has been done him." Eiðr said: "This is a good offer, father, to take self-judgment from the)Tj
