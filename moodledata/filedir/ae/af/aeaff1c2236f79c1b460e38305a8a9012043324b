(milking-stock to the mountain-dairy up in Hrafnkelsdalr, which was set up at a place called)Tj

T*
(and the drizzle had lifted. And so he takes into his hand a staff and a bridle, and a riding-rug. Then he)Tj
T*
(went on, passing Grjótteigsá, which ran above the dairy. On the shingly flats by the river were lying)Tj
T*
(about all the sheep that had been home in the evening before. These he drove home towards the dairy,)Tj
T*
(and then went in search of those that were wanting. He now saw the stud-horses further afield on the)Tj
T*

T*

T*
(on it the bridle, and the riding-rug on his back under himself, and rode up past the gorge of Grjóta, and)Tj
T*
(farther up towards the glaciers, then along the "jökul," beneath whick Jökulsá runs, and then down)Tj
T*
(along the river unto the dairy of Reykir. He asked all shepherds at the sundry dairies if any of them)Tj
T*
(had set their eye upon the sheep, but no one professed to have seen them. Einarr rode "Freymane")Tj
T*
(from the first streak of dawn until middle eve, and the horse took him quickly over the ground and far,)Tj
T*
(for it was the best of horses. Then it came into Einarr’s mind that it was time already to drive home to)Tj
T*
(the dairy the sheep which were still in safe keeping, letting alone those that he could not find. So he)Tj
T*
(rode to the eastward over the mountain-necks into Hrafnkelsdalr. But as he came down by Grjótteigr,)Tj
T*
(he heard the bleating of sheep along the river-gorge, even where he had ridden close by before; and)Tj
T*
(turning thither, sees how thirty ewes come running along towards him, even the very ones which had)Tj
T*
(been missing for a whole week already, and these, with the rest of the ewes, he drove along home to)Tj
T*
(the dairy. The horse was all foaming with sweat, so that every hair on him was dripping; bespattered)Tj
T*
(he was all over with mire, and mightily blown. Twelve times he rolled himself, and then he set up a)Tj
T*
(mighty neighing, and then set off at a swift pace down along the beaten tracks. Einarr ran forthwith)Tj
T*
(after him, endeavouring to overtake him, and to lay hand on him and bring him back to the horses. But)Tj
T*
(now "Freymane" was so shy, that Einarr could get nowhere near him. Thus the horse ran down all)Tj
T*
(along the valley, never stopping until it came home to Aðalból. At the time Hrafnkell sat at table, and)Tj
T*
(when the horse came before the door it neighed aloud. Hrafnkell told one of the handmaidens who)Tj
T*
(were serving at table, to go to the door, "for I heard the neighing of a horse, and meseemed the)Tj
T*
(neighing was like to that of ’Frey-mayne.’" She went out to the door, and there beheld "Freymane" in a)Tj
T*
(most ungainly plight. She told Hrafnkell that "Freymane" stood outside the door most ill-favoured of)Tj
T*
(look. "What is the matter with the champion that he should come home as at this time," says Hrafnkell;)Tj
T*
("sure that bodes no good." Then he went out and saw "Freymane," and spoke to him: "I am sorry to)Tj
T*
(see thee in this kind of plight, my pet; however, thou hadst all thy wits about thee in thus coming to let)Tj
T*
(me know what is the matter; due revenge shall be taken for this, and now thou mayest go back to thy)Tj

T*
(and where he had got a home. The other said he was a West-firther by kin and origin, and that his)Tj

T*
(the other. "Art thou a bonder then?" said Sámr. He said that was not so. Sámr asked: "What of a man)Tj

(ropes which then they slung over the aforenamed beam, and there tied them up, eight together. Then)Tj
T*
(said Thorgeirr: "Now thou hast been brought to such a plight, Hrafnkell, as thou deservest, unlikely as)Tj
T*
(thou wouldst have deemed it, that thou shouldst ever have received such a shame at any man’s hands)Tj
T*
(as now has come to pass. Now which wilt thou do, Thorkell, sit here beside Hrafnkell and watch them,)Tj
T*
(or go outside the farmstead with Sámr within the distance of an arrow shot, and there execute the act)Tj
T*
(of distress on some stony knoll where there be neither field nor meadow." \(This was to be done at the)Tj
T*
(time when the sun was in due south.\) Thorkell answered: "I will sit there beside Hrafnkell, and thus)Tj
T*
(have less to do." Then Thorgeirr and Sámr executed the act of distress. Now after this they walked)Tj
T*
(home and took down Hrafnkell and his men, and set them down in a field; and then blood had already)Tj
T*
(filled their eyes. Then said Thorgeirr to Sámr that he should now deal with Hrafnkell as he liked, "for)Tj
T*
(meseems it is now a matter of small difficulty to deal with him." Then answered Sámr: "Two choices)Tj
T*
(are set before thee, Hrafnkell; one to be taken outside the stead, together with those of thy men that I)Tj
T*
(choose, and to be slaughtered; but whereas thou hast a great number of useless mouths to provide for, I)Tj
T*
(will allow thee to look thereto. So the second choice is, if thou wilt have thy life, that thou betake)Tj
T*
(thyself from Aðalból with all thy folk and with so much money only as I share to thee, which shall be)Tj
T*
(mighty little; but I shall settle on thy property and have the rule of all thy men; and to neither shalt)Tj
T*
(thou ever raise a claim, nor thy heirs, nor shalt thou ever live nearer this place than somewhere to the)Tj
T*
(east of Fljotsdalsherað; and this thou mayest handsel me if thou art ready to accept it." Hrafnkell)Tj
T*
(answered: "Many a man would think a swift death better than such hard dealings, but, belike, I shall)Tj
T*
(fare after the manner of many, ’that life be chosen while choice there is;’ which I do, mostly because)Tj
T*
(of my sons, for theirs will be a scanty prospect if I die from them." Then Hrafnkell was let loose and)Tj
T*
(he handselled self-doom unto Sámr. Sámr allowed Hrafnkell so much of the wealth as he chose, which)Tj
T*
(was a slight portion indeed. His spear Hrafnkell retained, but no weapon besides; and this very day he)Tj
T*
(betook himself from Aðalból together with all his folk. Then said Thorkell to Sámr: "I wonder at thy)Tj
T*

(Hrafnkell brought his household east over Fljótsdals-herað and right across Fljótsdalr unto the eastern)Tj
T*

T*

T*

T*
(afterwards, and never made a sacrifice again. Now Hrafnkell sat at Hrafnkelsstaðir, raking money)Tj

("Sooth, indeed, are most of the old saws; ’so one grows craven as one grows old;’ that honour mostly)Tj
T*
(cometh to but little which, beginning early, is allowed to drop into dishonour, the bearer having no)Tj
T*

(riding in blue raiment, and to me he seems to bear the likeness of Hrafnkell, the priest, although I have)Tj

T*
(need fear the anger of Hrafnkell, having never done aught to offend him. No doubt he has some errand)Tj
T*

T*

T*
(him and my brother Sámr since their atonement." The youth answered: "I wish thou wouldst ride away)Tj
T*
(west to the dale, where thou shalt be in safety; but I know so much of Hrafnkell’s temper, that he will)Tj
T*
(do nothing to us, if he should miss thee; for, if thou alone be safe, then all things are well seen to; then)Tj
T*
(there ’be no bear to tug along,’ and that is well, whatsoever may become of us." Eyvindr said he felt)Tj
T*
(no desire to ride so hurriedly away, "for I know not who the men may be, and many a man would find)Tj
T*
(a matter good to laugh at if I should run away before it came to any trial at all." Now they rode west)Tj
T*

T*
(all but impassable. Hence old Hallfreðr struck the higher tracks, though they were longer. Now)Tj
T*
(Eyvindr rode westward into the bog-land, where the horses came by, plentifully weltering in the mire;)Tj
T*
(and they were much delayed because thereof. The others, riding loose, quickly covered the ground,)Tj
T*
(and Hrafnkell and his men rode their way towards the bog-land. And just as Eyvindr had got over the)Tj
T*
(bogs, he saw that there was come Hrafnkell and both his sons. Now Eyvindr’s men bade him ride)Tj
T*
(away, now all trammels are past, "And thou wilt have time to reach Aðalból while the bog-land lies)Tj
T*

T*

T*
(windswept place surrounded by high banks. Up to this spot Eyvindr rode, and got there off his horse)Tj

T*
(where the fight had stood, and saw how matters had come about between them, and how Hrafnkell)Tj

(did, was to try if there still lingered life in the body of his brother, and carefully he was searched; but)Tj
T*
(they had all lost their lives, five of them together. Of Hrafnkell’s men, twelve had fallen, but six had)Tj
