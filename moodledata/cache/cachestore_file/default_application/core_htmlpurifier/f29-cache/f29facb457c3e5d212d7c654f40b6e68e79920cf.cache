Please feel free to reach out at any time!</i></span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span><i>The information within these halls comes from a wide variety of sources. Online, in print, handed down verbally in stories..  I have tried to steer away from UPG, but, as with all things, there is some within this course. Sources have been provided where available and needed. No one person takes credit for this course as a whole. </i></span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span><i>The courses within these halls are meant to prepare you with a good foundation for the life of a Goðar. This is by no means the be-all-end-all of your studies. Heathenry is a religion of learning, growing, and developing YOUR way to work with the Gods, Ancestors, and Wights. </i></span></p>";
