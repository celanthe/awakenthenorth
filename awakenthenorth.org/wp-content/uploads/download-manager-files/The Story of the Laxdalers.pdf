T*

T*
(an outbower, and bids him bide her there; she sets the latch thereto. Then went she to Thord and spake:)Tj
T*
(Here is come a man to guesting who hight Thorolf, and he is something akin to me; he may well need)Tj
T*
(to abide here some length of time if thou will that so it be. Thord said that the abiding of men liked)Tj

T*
(his swiftest. Vigdis answers : Already have I promised him guesting, and that word may I not take)Tj
T*
(back, though he be not an even friend to all men. After that she told Thord of the slaying of Hall, and)Tj

(this therewith that Thorolf who was then come thither had slain him. Thord was ill pleased at that; he)Tj

(spake: That way mayst thou best win the game of me, and yet it is all against my will that so hapless a)Tj
T*
(man be here. But yet was Thorolf there through the winter. This learned Ingjald, who had to deal with)Tj
T*
(the cause of his brother. He makes ready to fare into the dales at the end of the winter, and put out a)Tj
T*
(ferry which he owned. They were twelve in all; they sail east with a fresh northwester and land in)Tj
T*
(Laxriveroyce in the evening; they lay up the boat and fare to Goddisteads that same evening, and come)Tj
T*
(not unlooked for: good cheer is made them there. Ingjald came to speech with Thord and told him his)Tj
T*
(errand; he said he had learned how Thorolf his brotherís bane was there. Thord said that it was no)Tj
T*
(matter of his. Ingjald bade him not wrangle; and we will make this bargain together, that thou give up)Tj
T*
(the man to me, and suffer me not to need toil thereto, but I have here three marks of silver; these shall)Tj
T*
(be thine own: I will also give over my claim against thee which thou hast brought on thine hands in the)Tj
T*
(sheltering of Thorolf. The fee seemed good to Thord; and the dropping was promised him of that claim)Tj
T*
(which he had before most feared, that he might suffer feescathe thereby. Then spake Thord: Now shall)Tj

(should they fare. Those Laxdalers now leapt from their horses and made ready to set on. Hrut bade his)Tj

(men take no heed of the odds, and leaps forth to meet them. He had a helm on his head, in one hand a)Tj

(drawn sword, and a shield in the other. He was of all men the best at fight. So wood was Hrut then,)Tj
T*
(that few endured to follow him. Well fought both sides for a time, but soon those Laxdalers found that)Tj
T*
(they were no match for such an one as Hrut was, because he slew two men at one onset. Then prayed)Tj
T*
(the Laxdalers for peace. Quoth Hrut that they should surely have peace. The housecarles of Hoskuld)Tj
T*
(were then all wounded that yet stood up; but four were slain. Hrut fared home and was somewhat)Tj
T*
(wounded, but his fellows little or not at all, because he had put himself most forward. That place is)Tj

(waxed wood wroth thereat, and quoth that he is minded to take of him ransack and man-tine; he)Tj

T*
(Goddi and Vigdis, there is no such blitheness between thee and Thord Yeller as aforetime, though at)Tj
T*
(first the enmity of those kinsmen fell off thee by reason of fee-gifts. This too deem I, Hoskuld, saith)Tj

T*
(as wise; he must be able to see that this is to the honour of both of you. Hoskuld was much appeased)Tj
T*
(by the counsel of Jorun; he deemeth it to be the very sooth. Now fare men betwixt them that were)Tj

(well, and doffeth his helm, and louteth to the king; but the king receiveth him with all blitheness. Then)Tj
T*
(they come to speech together: Olaf setteth forth his tale anew and telleth his errand at length and with)Tj
T*
(fair words. So endeth that business, that he said he had then on his hand the gold which Melkorka gave)Tj
T*
(him at their parting in Iceland; and thus said she, that thou, king, gavest it her for a tooth-fee. The king)Tj
T*
(took it and looked at the gold, and waxed wondrous red of face. Then spake the king: Sooth tokens are)Tj
T*
(these: yet they have no lack whereby they are the less worthy of mark, because thou so much favourest)Tj
T*
(thy mother that one may well know thee thereby. And for this cause will I surely acknowledge thy)Tj
T*
(kinship, Olaf, by the witness of these men who stand near us and hear my speech; this also shall come)Tj
T*
(of it, that I will bid thee to my court, with all thy company; but the worship ye shall have lies hereon,)Tj
T*
(to wit, whether I deem that a manís might is in thee, when I have tried thee more. Then the king lets)Tj
T*
(fetch horses for them to ride; and he sets men to make the ship snug, and to give heed to the lading that)Tj
T*
(they had. Then the king rideth to Dublin: and men deem that mickle tidings, whereas there was afaring)Tj
T*
(with him the son of his daughter who had been lifted thence a long while agone, when she was but)Tj
T*
(fifteen winters old. And yet was the fostermother of Melkorka the most astonished at the tidings: she)Tj
T*
(lay then bedridden, and was sick both by reason of sorrow and eld; and yet went she then staffless to)Tj
T*
(meet with Olaf. Then spake the king to Olaf: Here is now the fostermother of Melkorka, and she will)Tj
T*
(fain have tidings told her of thee concerning her daughterís welfare. Olaf greeted her with open arms)Tj
T*
(and set the carline on his knee, and told her how her fosterling abode in good case in Iceland. Then)Tj
T*
(Olaf gave her the knife and belt, and the carline knew the jewel and was fain even to tears; she said)Tj
T*
(that so it was, that the son of Melkorka was both a man of proud bearing; and well doth that sit upon)Tj
T*
(him. The carline was astir all that winter. The king sat little in peace, because there was then ever)Tj
T*
(raiding in the westlands; the king drave before him that winter wickings and ravagers. Olaf and his)Tj
T*
(company were on the kingís ship, and that company was held somewhat ill to deal with by such as)Tj
T*
(were against them. Then the king had speech with Olaf and his fellows, and took rede with them in all)Tj
T*
(things, because Olaf was approved to be both wise and forward in all trials of manhood. But at the)Tj
T*
(close of winter the king summoned a Thing and it was fully thronged. The king stood up and spake.)Tj
T*
(Thus took he up the tale: It is well known to you that last harvest came hither the man who is my)Tj
T*
(daughterís son, and of high lineage by his fatherís kin: Olaf has shown himself to be so mickle a man)Tj
T*
(of his hands and wight that we have here no such men to set beside him. Now will I bid him take the)Tj
T*
(kingdom after my day, because Olaf is better fitted than my sons to be a ruler of the folk. Olaf)Tj
T*
(thanketh him for that bidding with much courtesy and fair words: and yet, he said, he might not well)Tj
T*
(risk how the kingís sons would thole it when Myrkjartan was departed: better was it, said he, to win)Tj
T*
(swift worship than long dishonour : he would fain fare to Norway so soon as it was free of risk for)Tj
T*
(ships to ply from land to land: little joy, said he, would his mother have if he came not back. The king)Tj
T*
(bade Olaf have his way. Then was the Thing sundered. But when Olafís ship was all-boun, the king)Tj
T*
(goeth with Olaf to the ship, and gave him a spear done about with gold and a fair-wrought sword and)Tj
T*
(much other wealth. Olaf prayed that he might flit the foster-mother of Melkorka abroad with him. The)Tj
T*
(king said there was no need of this; and she fared not. Olaf and his folk went aboard their ship, and he)Tj
T*
(and the king parted with full mickle friendship. After that sail Olaf and his folk out to sea. They had a)Tj
T*
(good voyage and made Norway; and Olafís faring is much noised abroad: now they lay up their ship.)Tj
T*
(Olaf getteth him horses, and seeketh now to Harald the king with his faring-fellows.)Tj

(that thou deemedst thou hadst a silver ring on thine arm; so shalt thou be given to a second man, a man)Tj
T*
(of renown; him shalt thou love much, but enjoy him a short while: it looketh to me not unlike that thou)Tj

(is far the loftier. But whereas thou didst deem that the ring brake asunder, somewhat by thy lack of)Tj

(watchfulness, and thou sawest blood come from out the pieces, so shall that husband of thine be slain;)Tj
T*
(then mayst thou look to see clearly those faults that have run athwart that marriage. And again spake)Tj

(Guest: This is thy fourth dream, that thou deemedst thou hadst a helm upon thy head, of gold and set)Tj

(may bide awake ; no hurt shall come to us if we fare in such wise. But yet all men slept. Hrut was)Tj

(longest awake, and yet he too slept at last. Kari hight a son of Hrut; he was then twelve winters old,)Tj

(for him was the play made ; he felt not much at his ease. Kari sprang up and looked out; he came)Tj

T*

T*
(let set down close by them such evil men as were Kotkel and his folk. He said moreover that Thorleik)Tj
T*
(had dealt himself an evil lot in his doings with Hrut; but yet, quoth he, greater has the loss been than)Tj

(aught he can have wished for. Olaf said that they should straightway slay Kotkel, and his wife and)Tj

T*

T*
(Osvif: Then shall many men say that this is spoken rather from pride than of mickle wisdom, if thou)Tj
T*
(naysay such a man as is Bolli; but while I am to the fore I shall use foresight for you my children in)Tj
T*
(such matters as I can look to better than ye. But when Osvif took this thing so athwart, Gudrun held)Tj
T*
(out no longer for her part, but yet she was full hard in all wise. The sons of Osvif are much fain of this)Tj

T*
(that same time it so befell that Gudrun was come over against the shut-bed wherein Kjartan was wont)Tj

T*
(make answer: Hrefna shall sit in the highseat and be held first every way, whiles I am on live. But)Tj
T*
(Gudrun had ever aforetime been given the highseat at Herdholt and elsewhere. Gudrun heard this and)Tj
T*
(looked at Kjartan and changed hue, but answered nought. The next day spake Gudrun to Hrefna that)Tj
T*
(she should put on her the wimple, and so let men look on the best jewel that had ever come to Iceland.)Tj
T*
(Kjartan was there, though not very near, and heard what Gudrun spake. He was quicker to answer than)Tj
T*
(Hrefna: She shall not put on the wimple at this guesting, because I deem it of greater weight that)Tj
T*
(Hrefna should own that best of treasures than that the guests should at this time have eyesport)Tj
T*
(therewith. A week should the harvest-feast endure at Olafís. The next day spake Gudrun privily to)Tj
T*
(Hrefna that she should show her the wimple. She said that so it should be. The day after they go to the)Tj
T*
(out-bower wherein were the jewels. Hrefna opened the chest and took out the fair-woven poke, and)Tj
T*
(from the poke she took the wimple and showed it to Gudrun. She opened the wimple and looked at it)Tj
T*

T*
(to their places. After that fared forth the glee and game: but that day when the guests should ride away,)Tj
T*
(Kjartan was much busied with getting shift of horses for such as were come from afar, and such)Tj
T*
(faring-service for each as he needed. Kjartan had not the sword Kingís-loom in hand when he had)Tj
T*
(turned to this business; yet was he seldom wont to let it be far from his hand. Sithence went he to his)Tj
T*
(room, whereas the sword had lain, and it was gone. He went straight to his father to tell him of the)Tj
T*
(ill-hap. Olaf spake: Herein must we fare most privily: and I shall put men to seek news in every flock)Tj
T*
(of those that ride forth. And so did he. An the White should ride with the folk of Osvif, and watch for)Tj
T*
(the off-turning or tarrying of men. They ride inward by Leashaws and past the homestead that hight)Tj
T*
(Shaws,and they tarried by the shaw-side and there got off their horses. Thorolf Osvifson fared from the)Tj
T*
(stead and some other men with him: they turned aside into a certain copse while the rest tarried by the)Tj
T*
(shaw-side. An went with them as far as Laxwater that falls from Saelingsdale, and said then that he)Tj
T*
(must turn back. Thorolf made answer that no hurt would it have been had he not fared at all. That night)Tj
T*
(had a little snow fallen, so that steps might be tracked. An rode back to the shaw and followed up the)Tj
T*
(tracks of Thorolf to a certain well or fen. There he feels about with his hand,and gript the sword-hilt.)Tj
T*
(An would have witness with him in this matter, and rode for Thorarin at Saelingsdale-Tongue, and he)Tj
T*
(fared with An to take up the sword. After that An brought the sword to Kjartan. Kjartan wrapt it in a)Tj
T*
(napkin and laid it in a chest. That since hight Sword-well, where Thorolf hid Kingís-loom. Now men)Tj
T*
(held their peace over this, but the scabbard was never again found. Kjartan had ever less heed to the)Tj
T*
(sword sithence than aforetime. Kjartan said that this bit him deep, and he could not let it rest so. Olaf)Tj
T*

T*
(not others have cause to mock at us in that we break the peace for such a thing, whereas against us are)Tj

(Thorkel hight a bonder; he dwelt at Goatcrags in Swinedale; it is now waste land there. He had fared to)Tj
T*
(his horses that day, and his shepherd with him. They saw both of them the men of Bathstead lying in)Tj
T*
(wait, and then Kjartanís company, as they rode three in all south along the dale. Then spake the)Tj
T*

T*
(they might prevent so mickle trouble as was then toward. Thorkel spake : Hold thy peace, and that)Tj
T*
(quickly; thou born fool, thou mayst not give life to any man if his bane be set. This too is sooth, that I)Tj

T*

T*
(he the ambush, and knew the men, and sprang straightway from his horse and turned to meet those)Tj
T*
(sons of Osvif. Thereby stood a mickle stone ; here Kjartan bade that they should hold their ground. But)Tj
T*
(before they came together, Kjartan drave with a spear, and smote the shield of Thorolf above the)Tj
T*

T*
(the elbow, and therewith sundered the great muscle; then Thorolf let drop the shield, and his arm was)Tj
T*
(useless to him all that day. Afterward Kjartan drew his sword; and he had not as then Kingís-loom.)Tj
T*
(Those brethren the sons of Thorhalla ran on Thorarin: he was a big man and a strong, and they too)Tj
T*
(were right deft men: not easy was it to see which of them should get the better of the other. Then set)Tj
T*
(the sons of Osvif on Kjartan, and Gudlaug with them; they were six, but Kjartan and An two. An)Tj
T*
(warded him well, and would ever be going out before Kjartan. Bolli stood by with Footbiter. Kjartan)Tj
T*
(hewed hard, but the sword bit ill: he must always be straightening it under his foot. On both sides were)Tj
T*
(men wounded, the sons of Osvif and An, but Kjartan had as yet no wound. Kjartan fought so fiercely)Tj
T*
(and valiantly that the sons of Osvif gave back, and turned therewith whereas An was. Then fell An,)Tj
T*
(and he had so fought for a space, that his guts hung out. In that onset Kjartan hewed the leg from)Tj

(turned on Kjartan. Then spake Kjartan to Bolli: Surely thou art minded now to do nithings-work; but)Tj
T*
(far better do I deem it to take the word of bane from thee, kinsman, than to give it to thee. Then)Tj

(exceeding fight-weary. No answer made Bolli to the words of Kjartan, but yet he gave him his)Tj

(knees of Bolli. Bolli straightway rued him of the deed, and gave out the slaying as his work. Then)Tj

T*
(and asked him how the time had sped. Bolli said it was nigh noon. Spake Gudrun: Mickle prowess)Tj
T*
(hath been done; I have spun yarn for twelve ells, and thou hast slain Kjartan. Then saith Bolli: Yet)Tj
T*
(may that illhap pass slowly from my heart, though thou mind me not thereof. Gudrun spake: I reckon)Tj
T*
(not such with ill haps; methought thou hadst more honour that winter when Kjartan was in Norway,)Tj
T*
(and now hath he trodden you under foot from the time that he came out to Iceland; and that tell I last)Tj
T*
(which I deem of most worth, that Hrefna shall not go laughing to bed this night. Then saith Bolli, and)Tj
T*
(was sore wroth: Unsure I deem it that she pales more than thou at these tidings; and methinks it like)Tj
T*
(that thou wouldst be less moved, though I were left lying on the fight-meads, and Kjartan told thee of)Tj
T*
(the tidings. Gudrun marked that Bolli grew wroth, and then she spake: Make no such words, quoth)Tj
T*
(she, for I can thee much thank for that work; now meseems I know this, that thou wilt not do aught)Tj
T*
(against my will. Afterward went the sons of Osvif into that earthhouse which had been privily made)Tj
T*
(for them ; but the sons of Thorhalla were sent to Holy fell, to tell the tidings to Snorri the priest; and)Tj
T*
(this therewith, that they should bid him give them some speedy aid against Olaf and those men who)Tj
T*
(would follow up the bloodsuit for Kjartan. Now it came to pass at Saelings-dale-Tongue the same)Tj
T*
(night after the day wherein the slaying had been done, that An sat up, whom all men thought to be)Tj
T*
(dead; they were afeared that waked the bodies, and mickle wonder that seemed to them. Then spake)Tj
T*
(An to them: I bid you in Godís name that ye fear not me; for I have lived all this time, and have had all)Tj
T*
(my wits until within this hour; but now came over me the heaviness of a swoon. Then I dreamed of)Tj
T*
(that same wife as last night, and methought she took the small wood out of my belly, and let the guts)Tj
T*
(come in place thereof, and good was the change for me. Then were those wounds bound up that An)Tj
T*
(had, and he grew whole, and was called afterward An Copsebelly. But when Olaf Hoskuldson heard)Tj
T*
(these tidings, he was sore grieved for the slaying of Kjartan, and yet he bare him in manly wise; but his)Tj
T*
(sons would fare straightway against Bolli and slay him. Then spake Olaf: That shall in nowise be; no)Tj
T*
(boot would it be to me for my son though Bolli were slain. And albeit I loved Kjartan beyond all other)Tj
T*
(men, yet I would not that any hurt should come to Bolli. But I see a befitting errand for you; do ye fare)Tj
T*
(against the sons of Thorhalla Wordy, for I have learned that they have been sent to Holyfell to)Tj
T*
(summon a host to the sons of Osvif: well were it methinks that ye should deal them such wife as it)Tj
T*
(likes you. Then those sons of Olaf made them ready to fare, and went to the ferry that Olaf had ; and)Tj
T*
(they were four in all. They rowed out along Hvammsfirth, and seek forth on their way eagerly. They)Tj
T*
(have light wind and fair weather, and row under sail till they come under Score-isle, and there abide)Tj

(beaches northward to Leashaws; that was at the oncoming of night. They stay not now their faring till)Tj
T*
(that they come to Saelingsdale; by then was the dawn breaking. The wood was thick in the dale. Bolli)Tj
T*
(was there in the fell-cot, even as Halldor had learned. The cot stood by a stream, where it is since)Tj
T*
(called Bolliís Tofts. A mickle holt runs above the fell-cot and down to Stack Gill. Betwixt the)Tj
T*
(hill-slope and the holt is a mickle meadow which hight Brim; there were the housecarles of Bolli at)Tj
T*
(work. Halldor and his fellows rode to Oxdike over Ranmeads, and up to the place called)Tj
T*
(Hammer-meadow ; that is over against the cot. They were aware that many men were in the cot; they)Tj
T*
(dismounted and were minded to abide until men went from the cot to their work. The shepherd of)Tj
T*
(Bolli fared to his flock early in the morning up the hillside. He saw men in the wood, and likewise)Tj
T*
(horses, which were tied in the ditch; he misdoubts that those men will be on no peaceful errand that)Tj
T*
(fared so privily: thereon he makes for the cot by the straightest way, and is minded to tell Bolli of the)Tj
T*
(coming of those men. Halldor Olafson was the keenest-eyed of all men: he sees that a man is coming)Tj
T*
(down the hillside and back to the cot: he saith to his fellows that this must be the shepherd of Bolli:)Tj
T*
(And he will have seen our faring: and now must we cut him off and suffer him not to bring news to the)Tj
T*
(cot. So did those fellows of his as he bade them. An Copsebelly was the fleetest of that fellowship: and)Tj
T*
(he overtakes the shepherd: he catcheth him by the arm and forceth him down. The lad fell in such wise)Tj
T*
(that his back was broken asunder. Afterward rode they to the fell-cot. The cot was twofold : there was)Tj
T*
(a sleeping hut and a bower. Bolli had been afoot early in the morning and given orders about the work,)Tj
T*
(but then laid him down to sleep when his housecarles had fared forth; they two were alone in the cot,)Tj
T*
(Bolli and Gudrun. They awoke with the din as the others leapt from horseback: they heard them)Tj
T*
(talking over this, to wit, who should first go into the fell-cot against Bolli. Bolli knew the voice of)Tj
T*
(Halldor and of many of his fellows. Then spake Bolli to Gudrun, and bade her go forth from the cot;)Tj
T*
(he said that the meeting with those men is like to be one which it will be no sport for her to look on.)Tj
T*
(Gudrun answers: her mind was, quoth she, that only such tidings would come to pass there as she)Tj
T*
(might well look on; no harm, she said, might come to Bolli though she were standing nigh him. Bolli)Tj
T*
(said that he must rule herein. And so it was, that Gudrun went out of the fell-cot and up the brent to the)Tj
T*
(beck that fell theredown, and set to washing her linen. Bolli was now alone in the cot. He took his)Tj
T*
(weapons, put a helm on his head; he had a shield before him, Footbiter in his hand; no byrny had he.)Tj
T*
(Now Halldor and his fellows take rede among them which shall set on, because none was eager to go)Tj

(into the cot. Then spake An Copsebelly: There are men here a-faring, quoth he, who were more nearly)Tj
T*
(bound by kinship to Kjartan than I; but none that may be more mindful of that onset when Kjartan was)Tj
T*
(slain: that was in my heart when I was borne back to Tongue scarce alive, but Kjartan dead, that I)Tj

T*
(methinks Skofnung is well bestowed if thou bear him. But such is the nature of the sword, that the sun)Tj

T*
(of mickle worthy and they deem that they have long been set over a maimed lot. And it is told me of)Tj

T*
(as was written afore. Now sails Thorkel to sea straightway: he got a calm passage, yet not right)Tj

T*

T*
(was, and spake: What is it now, Thorkel? Art thou minded to frame after this fashion the)Tj
T*
(church-timber that thou flittest to Iceland? Saith Thorkel that this was sooth. Then spake Olaf the king:)Tj
T*
(Hew thou off two ells from every main-beam, and that church will yet be the greatest builded in all)Tj
T*
(Iceland. Then answered Thorkel: This is my will, that thou take the timber to thee again if thou deem)Tj
T*
(that thou hast given me overmuch, or if it be thy pleasure to have it back: but I will not hew one ellís)Tj
T*
(length thereof: I may well toil and strive to win me other timber. Now is it, Thorkel, quoth the king,)Tj
T*
(that thou art of mickle worth, yet full proudly thou bearest thyself: because I surely deem it)Tj
T*
(overweening that any bonder should match himself with us. But it is not sooth that I grudge thee the)Tj
T*
(timber, if so be it befall thee to build a church therewith : for it may not be so great that all thy pride)Tj
T*
(will lie therein. But thuswise my heart forbodes, that little gain will be to men of this timber, and)Tj
T*
(furthermore that thou shalt not get done even one manís work upon the timber. After this they sunder)Tj
T*
(speech. The king turneth away, and it was marked that he was none the better pleased that Thorkel)Tj
T*
(recked nought of that which he enjoined him. Yet the king let no wind of this get abroad. He and)Tj
T*
(Thorkel parted in the most goodliking. Now goes Thorkel a-shipboard: when he is boun he puts out to)Tj
T*
(sea. Well went it with him: they were but a short while at sea. Thorkel brought his ship into Ramfirth.)Tj

(go with them. Beinir went after Halldor none the less, because he deemed that things were faring much)Tj
