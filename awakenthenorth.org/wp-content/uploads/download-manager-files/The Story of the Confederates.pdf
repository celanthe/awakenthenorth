(hight a man who grew up in Úfeigr’s home; he was a hopeful man, and much liked. Oddr grew up in)Tj

T*
(loved him but little. The report was afloat that no one round about there was better accomplished than)Tj

T*
(He soon earned so much that he was the sole owner of the ferry, and thus he goes for some few)Tj

T*
("May be that soon things may take a turn, so as to make my circumstances easy." "How may that come)Tj

T*
(shall not be in lack for money; for great things, indeed, are told to us of all his riches." Said Úfeigr: "It)Tj
T*

T*
(to thee what thy share in the wealth may amount to, seeing that thou art so much in want of money.")Tj
T*
("That is true," said Egill, "and a good old carl and wise thou art, and knowest, no doubt, the whole)Tj
T*
(truth about Oddr’s riches." He said: "I am minded to think that that matter is better known to no one)Tj
T*

T*
(arranged that you yourselves should have one-half of Oddr’s wealth, and the Quartermen the other)Tj
T*
(half; then my counting comes to this, if there are eight confederates of you together, that the half of the)Tj
T*
(land of Melr must fall to your share. This is according to your own arrangement, and according to)Tj
T*
(what you have declared yourself in an affair taken up in such an unheard-of manner as no example)Tj
T*
(may be found to match -- but, whatever the character of your suit, these are your terms. Now did you)Tj
T*
(really expect that my son, Oddr, would sit quietly to let you come upon him rushing from the south?)Tj
T*
(No, Oddr is not the man to sit unready in your way, and abundant as is his wealth, he is no less)Tj

T*
(misdoubts me that his good ship will glide none the slower under him through the Iceland main that ye)Tj

T*
(surely it shall fall on those who have undertaken it, and by this time I expect him to be out on the main)Tj
T*
(with all that is his, with the exception of the land at Melr, that he intends to leave to you. Rumour, too,)Tj

T*

(confederates. Then said Hermundr: "Stand we up, and listen to the shame that shall befall." Then said)Tj
T*
(Gellir: "We shall not be wiser by waiting; it will all come to one thing, and my and Egill’s award is,)Tj
T*
(that a fine of thirteen ounces of silver be paid to us confederates." Then said Hermundr: "Did I)Tj
T*
(understand it right, didst thou say thirteen tens of ounces of silver?" Egill answered: "Surely,)Tj
T*
(Hermundr, thou wert not sitting upon thy ear for thou wert standing! thirteen ounces, certainly! and in)Tj
T*
(such wares as are offerable only to paupers, for it shall be paid in rags of shields, and bits of broken)Tj
T*
(rings, and in whatever trifles can be collected for it; and you may like the worst." Then said Hermundr:)Tj
T*
("Now, Egill, thou hast betrayed us!" "Is it so," said Egill; "dost thou find that thou art betrayed?")Tj
T*
("Betrayed, indeed, I deem myself, and thou art the man I have to thank for it" Egill answered: "I deem)Tj
T*
(it well to have betrayed a man who trusts in no one, not even in himself, the which I can prove, for)Tj
T*
(thou didst hide thy money away, that thou intendedst that even though it should come into thy mind to)Tj
T*
(look for it, you should never find it." Hermundr answered: "This is like thy other lies, Egill. Thou didst)Tj
T*
(say the other winter, when thou earnest home after having been invited by me from your abode of)Tj
T*
(poverty during Christmas, the which thou acceptedst gladly as might be expected; but when Yule was)Tj
T*
(over, sadness settled upon thee, and no wonder, having to look forward to a return to starvation; but I,)Tj
T*
(finding it out, offered thee to remain still with another man with thee, which offer thou tookst and wast)Tj
T*
(very glad of it. But in the spring after Easter, when thou returnedst to Borg, thou spreadest the news,)Tj
T*
(that thirty horses, turned out into ice and snow, and had all been eaten." Egill answered: "I think it)Tj
T*
(would be difficult to say too much about the flaws of your household; but of these horses I think that)Tj
T*
(few or even none were eaten. But that all men know, that neither I nor my people are ever of lack of)Tj

(food, though my circumstances as to money being not always equally easy. But of the state of thy own)Tj
T*
(house, the less you say the better." "I should like," said Hermundr, "that we two should not have to)Tj
T*
(meet next summer at the ’Þing’ again." Answered Egill: "Now I will say that which I thought would)Tj
T*
(never come over my lips, namely, to thank you for what thou hast said; for as to me, it has been)Tj
T*
(foretold, that I shall die of old age, but the sooner the trolls take you, the better." Then spake Styrmir:)Tj
T*
("He, who tells the worst of thee, Egill, tells the truest tale, even he who calls thee a rogue." "That is all)Tj
T*
(right," said Egill; "the more thou blamest me, and the more proofs thou bringest in support of it, the)Tj
T*
(better, because I was told that at a banquet you amused yourself by choosing your equals, and that thou)Tj
T*
(choosest for thy equal none but myself. Now it is certain," said he further, "that thou hast about thee)Tj
T*
(some mighty garments to clothe thyself in, about which other people know nothing; and thou must)Tj
T*
(have the best knowledge of thyself as of thy other matters. But in this we are unlike to each other, that)Tj
T*
(we both engage in lending other people assistance, and I give all I can, sparing myself in nought, but)Tj

(thou takest to thy heels, as soon as a few blacklegs are aloft. It is also true that my household always)Tj

(that thou hast a bowl, which is called ’Meatsome,’ the contents of which no one knows about, no)Tj
T*
(matter how many may be the visitors to your house except thou alone. Now it is no dishonour to me)Tj

(that my servants endure hardships when want is at the door, but it is a greater dishonour to starve one’s)Tj
