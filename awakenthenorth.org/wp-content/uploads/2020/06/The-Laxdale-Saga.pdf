T*
(they rowed home in the evening they were very merry. Thorolf kept spying about Hallís doings during)Tj
T*
(the day, and is standing in the landing-place when Hall came to land. Hall rowed in the forehold of the)Tj

T*
(standing near, and forthwith hews at him, and the blow caught him on his neck against the shoulder,)Tj
T*
(and off flew his head. Thorolf fled away after that, and Hallís followers were all in a flurried bustle)Tj
T*
(about him. The story of Hallís murder was told all over the islands, and every one thought it was)Tj
T*
(indeed great news; for the man was of high birth, although he had had little good luck. Thorolf now)Tj
T*
(fled from the islands, for he knew no man there who would shelter him after such a deed, and he had)Tj
T*
(no kinsmen he could expect help from; while in the neighbourhood were men from whom it might be)Tj
T*
(surely looked for that they would beset his life, being moreover men of much power, such as was)Tj
T*
(Ingjald, the Sheepislesí Priest, the brother of Hall. Thorolf got himself ferried across to the mainland.)Tj
T*
(He went with great secrecy. Nothing is told of his journey, until one evening he came to Goddistead.)Tj
T*
(Vigdis, the wife of Thord Goddi, was some sort of relation to Thorolf, and on that account he turned)Tj
T*
(towards that house. Thorolf had also heard before how matters stood there, and how Vigdis was)Tj
T*
(endowed with a good deal more courage than Thord, her husband. And forthwith the same evening)Tj
T*
(that Thorolf came to Goddistead he went to Vigdis to tell her his trouble, and to beg her help. Vigdis)Tj
T*
(answered his pleading in this way: "I do not deny our relationship, and in this way alone I can look)Tj
T*
(upon the deed you have done, that I deem you in no way the worser man for it. Yet this I see, that)Tj
T*
(those who shelter you will thereby have at stake their lives and means, seeing what great men they are)Tj
T*
(who will be taking up the blood-suit. And Thord," she said, "my husband, is not much of a warrior; but)Tj
T*
(the counsels of us women are mostly guided by little foresight if anything is wanted. Yet I am loath to)Tj
T*
(keep aloof from you altogether, seeing that, though I am but a woman, you have set your heart on)Tj
T*
(finding some shelter here." After that Vigdis led him to an outhouse, and told him to wait for her there,)Tj
T*
(and put a lock on the door. Then she went to Thord, and said, "A man has come here as a guest, named)Tj
T*
(Thorolf. He is some sort of relation of mine, and I think he will need to dwell here some long time if)Tj
T*
(you will allow it." Thord said he could not away with men coming to put up at his house, but bade him)Tj
T*
(rest there over the next day if he had no trouble on hand, but otherwise he should be off at his swiftest.)Tj
T*
(Vigdis answered, "I have offered him already to stay on, and I cannot take back my word, though he)Tj

(Ingjald and his men got up and dressed. Vigdis asked Thord what his talk with Ingjald had been about)Tj

(themselves in a hole, for Ingjald was on one side of them and the Salmon River on the other. The river)Tj
T*
(was terribly swollen, and there were great masses of ice on either bank, while in the middle it had)Tj
T*
(burst open, and it was an ill-looking river to try to ford. Thorolf said to Asgaut, "It seems to me we)Tj
T*
(have two choices before us. One is to remain here and fight as well as valour and manhood will serve)Tj
T*
(us, and yet the thing most likely is that Ingjald and his men will take our lives without delay; and the)Tj

(Thorolf should have his way, and hewould not desert him, "whatever plan you are minded to follow in)Tj

(Now of Hoskuld it is to be told that his state is one of great honour, and that he is a great chieftain. He)Tj
T*
(had in his keep a great deal of money that belonged to his \(half\) brother, Hrut, Herjolfís son. Many)Tj
T*
(men would have it that Hoskuldís means would be heavily cut into if he should be made to pay to the)Tj
T*
(full the heritage of his \(Hrutís\) mother. Hrut was of the bodyguard of King Harald, Gunnhildís son,)Tj
T*
(and was much honoured by him, chiefly for the reason that he approved himself the best man in all)Tj
T*
(deeds of manly trials, while, on the other hand, Gunnhild, the Queen, loved him so much that she held)Tj
T*
(there was not his equal within the guard, either in talking or in anything else. Even when men were)Tj
T*
(compared, and noblemen therein were pointed to, all men easily saw that Gunnhild thought that at the)Tj
T*
(bottom there must be sheer thoughtlessness, or else envy, if any man was said to be Hrutís equal. Now,)Tj
T*
(inasmuch as Hrut had in Iceland much money to look after, and many noble kinsfolk to go and see, he)Tj
T*
(desired to go there, and now arrays his journey for Iceland. The king gave him a ship at parting, and)Tj
T*
(said he had proved a brave man and true. Gunnhild saw Hrut off to his ship, and said, "Not in a hushed)Tj
T*
(voice shall this be spoken, that I have proved you to be a most noble man, in that you have prowess)Tj
T*
(equal to the best man here in this land, but are in wits a long way before them". Then she gave him a)Tj
T*
(gold ring and bade him farewell. Whereupon she drew her mantle over her head and went swiftly)Tj
T*
(home. Hrut went on board his ship, and put to sea. He had a good breeze, and came to Broadfirth. He)Tj
T*
(sailed up the bay, up to the island, and, steering in through Broadsound, he landed at Combness, where)Tj
T*
(he put his gangways to land. The news of the coming of this ship spread about, as also that Hrut,)Tj
T*
(Herjolfís son, was the captain. Hoskuld gave no good cheer to these tidings, and did not go to meet)Tj
T*
(Hrut. Hrut put up his ship, and made her snug. He built himself a dwelling, which since has been)Tj
T*
(called Combness. Then he rode to see Hoskuld, to get his share of his motherís inheritance. Hoskuld)Tj
T*
(said he had no money to pay him, and said his mother had not gone without means out of Iceland)Tj
T*
(when she met with Herjolf. Hrut liked this very ill, but rode away, and there the matter rested. All)Tj
T*
(Hrutís kinsfolk, excepting Hoskuld, did honour to Hrut. Hrut now lived three winters at Combness,)Tj
T*
(and was always demanding the money from Hoskuld at the Thing meetings and other law gatherings,)Tj
T*
(and he spoke well on the matter. And most men held that Hrut had right on his side. Hoskuld said)Tj
T*
(thatThorgerd had not married Herjolf by his counsel, and that he was her lawful guardian, and there)Tj
T*
(the matter dropped. That same autumn Hoskuld went to a feast at Thord Goddiís, and hearing that,)Tj
T*
(Hrut rode with twelve men to Hoskuldstead and took away twenty oxen, leaving as many behind. Then)Tj

(went forward unto a certain sandhill. Hrut said that there they would make a stand, and added that)Tj

(though the money claim against Hoskuld sped slowly, never should that be said that he had run away)Tj
T*
(before his thralls. Hrutís followers said that they had odds to deal with. Hrut said he would never heed)Tj

(shield in the other. He was of all men the most skilled at arms. Hrut was then so wild that few could)Tj
T*
(keep up with him. Bothsides fought briskly for a while; but the men of Salmon-river-Dale very soon)Tj
T*
(found that in Hrut they had to deal with one for whom they were no match, for now he slew two men)Tj
T*
(at every onslaught. After that the men of Salmon-river-Dale begged for peace. Hrut replied that they)Tj
T*
(should surely have peace. All the house-carles of Hoskuld who were yet alive were wounded, and four)Tj
T*
(were killed. Hrut then went home, being somewhat wounded himself; but his followers only slightly or)Tj
T*
(not at all, for he had been the foremost in the fight. The place has since been called Fight-Dale where)Tj

(they fought. After that Hrut had the cattle killed. Now it must be told how Hoskuld got men together in)Tj
T*
(a hurry when he heard of the robbery and rode home. Much at the same time as he arrived his)Tj
T*
(house-carles came home too, and told how their journey had gone anything but smoothly. Hoskuld)Tj
T*
(was wild with wrath at this, and said he meant to take at Hrutís hand no robbery or loss of lives again,)Tj
T*
(and gathered to him men all that day. Then Jorunn, his wife, went and talked to him, and asked him)Tj
T*
(what he had made his mind up to. He said, "It is but little I have made up my mind to, but I fain would)Tj
T*
(that men should oftener talk of something else than the slaying of my house-carles". Jorunn answered,)Tj
T*
("You are after a fearful deed if you mean to kill such a man as your brother, seeing that some men will)Tj
T*
(have it that it would not have been without cause if Hrut had seized these goods even before this; and)Tj
T*
(now he has shown that, taking after the race he comes from, he means no longer to be an outcast, kept)Tj
T*
(from what is his own. Now, surely he cannot have made up his mind to try his strength with you till he)Tj
T*
(knew that he might hope for some backing-up from the more powerful among men; for, indeed, I am)Tj
T*
(told that messages have been passing in quiet between Hrut and Thord Yeller. And to me, at least,)Tj
T*
(such matters seem worthy of heed being paid to them. No doubt Thord will be glad to back up matters)Tj
T*
(of this kind, seeing how clear are the bearings of the case. Moreover you know, Hoskuld, that since the)Tj
T*
(quarrel between Thord Goddi and Vigdis, there has not been the same fond friendship between you)Tj
T*
(and Thord Yeller as before, although by means of gifts you staved off the enmity of him and his)Tj
T*
(kinsmen in the beginning. I also think, Hoskuld," she said, "that in that matter, much to the trial of)Tj
T*
(their temper, they feel they have come off worst at the hands of yourself and your son, Olaf. Now this)Tj
T*
(seems to me the wiser counsel: to make your brother an honourable offer, for there a hard grip from)Tj
T*
(greedy wolf may be looked for. I am sure that Hrut will take that matter in good part, for I am told he)Tj
T*
(is a wise man, and he will see that that would be an honour to both of you." Hoskuld quieted down)Tj
T*
(greatly at Jorunnís speech, and thought this was likely to be true. Then men went between them who)Tj
T*
(were friends of both sides, bearing words of peace from Hoskuld to Hrut. Hrut received them well, and)Tj
T*
(said he would indeed make friends with Hoskuld, and added that he had long been ready for their)Tj
T*
(coming to terms as behoved kinsmen, if but Hoskuld had been willing to grant him his right. Hrut also)Tj
T*
(said he was ready to do honour to Hoskuld for what he on his side had misdone. So now these matters)Tj
T*
(were shaped and settled between the brothers, who now take to living together in good brotherhood)Tj
T*
(from this time forth. Hrut now looks after his homestead, and became mighty man of his ways. He did)Tj
T*
(not mix himself up in general things, but in whatever matter he took a part he would have his own)Tj
T*
(way. Hrut now moved his dwelling, and abode to old age at a place which now is called Hrutstead. He)Tj
T*
(made a temple in his home-field, of which the remains are still to be seen. It is called Trollsí walk)Tj
T*
(now, and there is the high road. Hrut married a woman named Unn, daughter of Mord Fiddle. Unn left)Tj
T*
(him, and thence sprang the quarrels between the men of Salmon-river-Dale and the men of Fleetlithe.)Tj
T*
(Hrutís second wife was named Thorbjorg. She was Armodís daughter. Hrut married a third wife, but)Tj
T*
(her we do not name. Hrut had sixteen sons and ten daughters by these two wives. And men say that)Tj
T*
(one summer Hrut rode to the Thing meeting, and fourteen of his sons were with him. Of this mention)Tj

(is made, because it was thought a sign of greatness and might. All his sons were right goodly men.)Tj

(Hoskuld now remained quietly at home, and began now to sink into old age, and his sons were now all)Tj
T*
(grown up. Thorliek sets up household of his own at a place called Combness, and Hoskuld handed)Tj
T*
(over to him his portion. After that he married a woman named Gjaflaug, daughter of Arnbjorn, son of)Tj
T*
(Sleitu Bjorn, and Thordaug, the daughter of Thord of Headland. It was a noble match, Gjaflaug being)Tj
T*
(a very beautiful and high-minded woman. Thorliek was not an easy man to get on with, but was most)Tj

(warlike. There was not much friendship between the kinsmen Hrut and Thorliek. Bard Hoskuldís son)Tj

T*
(daughters of Hoskuld do not have much to do with this story, yet men are known who are descended)Tj

(from them. Olaf, Hoskuldís son, was now grown up, and was the handsomest of all men that people)Tj

(ever set eyes on. He arrayed himself always well, both as to clothes and weapons. Melkorka, Olafís)Tj
T*
(mother, lived at Melkorkastead, as has been told before. Hoskuld looked less after Melkorkaís)Tj
T*
(household ways than he used to do, saying that that matter concerned Olaf, her son. Olaf said he would)Tj
T*
(give her such help as he had to offer her. Melkorka thought Hoskuld had done shamefullyby her, and)Tj
T*
(makes up her mind to do something to him at which he should not be over pleased. Thorbjorn Skrjup)Tj
T*
(had chiefly had on hand the care of Melkorkaís household affairs. He had made her an offer of)Tj
T*
(marriage, after she had been an householder for but a little while, but Melkorka refused him flatly.)Tj
T*
(There was a ship up by Board-Ere in Ramfirth, and Orn was the name of the captain. He was one of)Tj
T*
(the bodyguard of King Harald, Gunnhildís son. Melkorka spoke to Olaf, her son, and said that she)Tj
T*
(wished he should journey abroad to find his noble relations, "For I have told the truth that Myrkjartan)Tj
T*
(is really my father, and he is king of the Irish and it would be easy for you betake you on board the)Tj
T*
(ship that is now at Board-Ere." Olaf said, "I have spoken about it to my father, but he seemed to want)Tj
T*
(to have but little to do with it; and as to the manner of my foster-fatherís money affairs, it so happens)Tj
T*
(that his wealth is more in land or cattle than in stores of islandic market goods." Melkorka said, "I)Tj
T*
(cannot bear your being called the son of a slave-woman any longer; and if it stands in the way of the)Tj
T*
(journey, that you think you have not enough money, then I would rather go to the length even of)Tj
T*
(marrying Thorbjorn, if then you should be more willing than before to betake yourself to the journey.)Tj
T*
(For I think he will be willing to hand out to you as much wares as you think you may need, if I give)Tj
T*
(my consent to his marrying me. Above all I look to this, that then Hoskuld will like two things)Tj
T*
(mightily ill when hecomes to hear of them, namely, that you have gone out of the land, and that I am)Tj
T*
(married." Olaf bade his mother follow her own counsel. After that Olaf talked to Thorbjorn as to how)Tj
T*
(he wished to borrow wares of him, and a great deal thereof. Thorbjorn answered, "I will do it on one)Tj
T*
(condition, and that is that I shall marry Melkorka for them; it seems to me, you will be as welcome to)Tj
T*
(my money as to that which you have in your keep." Olaf said that this should then be settled;)Tj
T*
(whereupon they talked between them of such matters as seemed needful, but all these things they)Tj
T*
(agreed should be kept quiet. Hoskuld wished Olaf to ride with him to the Thing. Olaf said he could not)Tj
T*
(do that on account of household affairs, as he also wanted to fence off a grazing paddock for lambs by)Tj
T*
(Salmon River. Hoskuld was very pleased that he should busy himself with the homestead. Then)Tj
T*
(Hoskuld rode to the Thing; but at Lambstead a wedding feast was arrayed, and Olaf settled the)Tj
T*
(agreement alone. Olaf took out of the undivided estate thirty hundred ellsí worth of wares, and should)Tj
T*
(pay no money for them. Bard, Hoskuldís son, was at the wedding, and was a party with them to all)Tj
T*
(these doings. When the feast was ended Olaf rode off to the ship, and found Orn the captain, and took)Tj

(berth with him. Before Olaf and Melkorka parted she gave him a great gold finger-ring, and said,)Tj
T*
("This gift my father gave me for a teething gift, and I know he will recognise it when he sees it." She)Tj

(also put into his hands a knife and a belt, and bade him give them to her nurse: "I am sure she will not)Tj

T*
(letting drop their talk. After that Orn went away, but Gunnhild and Olaf kept conversing together. Olaf)Tj

(told her of his wish, and how much store he set by carrying it out, saying he knew for certain that)Tj

(Then Gunnhild had a ship prepared and a crew got together, and bade Olaf say how many men he)Tj

T*
(matter of much concern to him, that such a company should be more like warriors than merchants. She)Tj
T*
(said that so it should be; and Orn is the only man mentioned by name in company with Olaf on this)Tj

T*
(said they wished to bestow on him their good-luck over and above other friendship they had bestowed)Tj
T*
(on him already. King Harald said that was an easy matter; for they must say that no goodlier a man)Tj
T*
(had in their days come out of Iceland. Then Harald the king asked how old a man he was. Olaf)Tj
T*
(answered, "I am now eighteen winters." The king replied, "Of exceeding worth, indeed, are such men)Tj

(as you are, for as yet you have left the age of child but a short way behind; and be sure to come and)Tj

(men got on board, and sailed out to sea. They came in for unfavourable weather through the summer,)Tj
T*
(had fogs plentiful, and little wind, and what there was was unfavourable; and wide about the main they)Tj
T*
(drifted, and on most on board fell "sea-bewilderment." But at last the fog lifted over-head; and the)Tj
T*
(wind rose, and they put up sail. Then they began to discuss in which direction Ireland was to be)Tj
T*
(sought; and they did not agree on that. Orn said one thing, and most of the men went against him, and)Tj
T*
(said that Orn was all bewildered: they should rule who were the greater in number. Then Olaf was)Tj

(asked to decide. He said, "I think we should follow the counsel of the wisest; for the counsels of)Tj

(foolish men I think will be of all the worseservice for us in the greater number they gather together.")Tj

(And now they deemed the matter settled, since Olaf spake in this manner; and Orn took the steering)Tj

T*
(their goods; and if they did so, they would do them no harm till the king had sat in judgment on their)Tj
T*
(case. Olaf said the law only held good when merchants had no interpreter with them. "But I can say)Tj
T*
(with truth these are peaceful men, and we will not give ourselves up untried." The Irish then raised a)Tj
T*
(great war-cry, and waded out into the sea, and wished to drag the ship, with them on board, to the)Tj
T*
(shore, the water being no deeper than reaching up to their armpits, or to the belts of the tallest. But the)Tj

T*
(knights rides towards them, looking a company of the bravest, they grow hushed, for they deemed here)Tj
T*

T*

T*
(their king." Then they rodeso near to the ship, that each could hear what the other said. The king asked)Tj
T*

T*
(whom he then was talking. He answered, "I am called Myrkjartan." Olaf asked, "Are you then a king)Tj
T*
(of the Irish?" He said he was. Then the king asked Olaf for news commonly talked of, and Olaf gave)Tj
T*
(good answers as to all news he was asked about. Then the king asked whence they had put to sea, and)Tj
T*
(whose men they were. And still the king asked, more searchingly than before, about Olafís kindred,)Tj
T*
(for the king found that this man was of haughty bearing, and would not answer any further than the)Tj

0 -1.2 TD
(seen in this Olaf, that he is high-born man, whether he be a kinsman of mine or not, as well as this, that)Tj
T*
(of all men he speaks the best of Irish." After that the king stood up, and said, "Now I will give answer)Tj
T*
(to your speech, in so far as we grant to you and all your shipmates peace; but on the kinship you claim)Tj
T*
(with us, we must talk more before I give answer to that." After that they put out their gangways to the)Tj
T*
(shore, and Olaf and his followers went on land from the ship; and the Irish now marvel much how)Tj
T*
(warrior-like these men are. Olaf greeted the king well, taking off his helmet and bowing to the king,)Tj
T*
(who welcomes Olaf with all fondness. Thereupon they fall to talking together, Olaf pleading his case)Tj
T*
(again in a speech long and frank; and at the end of his speech he said he had a ring on his hand that)Tj
T*
(Melkorka had given him at parting in Iceland, saying "that you, king, gave it her as a tooth gift." The)Tj
T*
(king took and looked at the ring, and his face grew wondrous red to look at; and then the king said,)Tj
T*
("True enough are the tokens, and become by no means less notable thereby that you have so many of)Tj
T*
(your motherís family features, and that even by them you might be easily recognised; and because of)Tj
T*
(these things I will in sooth acknowledge your kinship, Olaf, by the witnessing of these men that here)Tj
T*
(are near and hear my speech. And this shall also follow that I will ask you to my court, with all your)Tj
T*
(suite, but the honour of you all will depend thereon of what worth as a man I find you to be when I try)Tj
T*
(you more." After that the king orders riding-horses to be given to them, and appoints men to look after)Tj
T*
(their ship, and to guard the goods belonging to them. The King now rode to Dublin, and men thought)Tj
T*
(this great tidings, that with the king should be journeying the son of his daughter, who had been)Tj
T*
(carried off in war long ago when she was only fifteen winters old. But most startled of all at these)Tj
T*
(tidings was the foster-mother of Melkorka, who was then bed-ridden, both from heavy sickness and)Tj
T*
(old age; yet she walked with no staff even to support her, to meet Olaf. The king said to Olaf, "Here is)Tj
T*
(come Melkorkaís foster-mother, and she will wish to hear all the tidings you can tell about Melkorkaís)Tj
T*
(life." Olaf took her with open arms, and set the old woman on his knee, and said her foster-daughter)Tj
T*
(was well settled and in a good position in Iceland. Then Olaf put in her hands the knife and the belt,)Tj
T*
(and the old woman recognised the gifts, and wept for joy, and said it was easy to see that Melkorkaís)Tj
T*
(son was one of high mettle, and no wonder, seeing what stock he comes of. The old woman was strong)Tj
T*
(and well, and in good spirits all that winter. The king was seldom at rest, for at that time the lands in)Tj
T*
(the west were at all times raided by war-bands. The king drove from his land that winter both Vikings)Tj
T*
(and raiders. Olaf was with his suite in the kingís ship, and those who came against them thought his)Tj
T*
(was indeed a grim company to deal with. The king talked over with Olaf and his followers all matters)Tj
T*
(needing counsel,for Olaf proved himself to the king both wise and eager-minded in all deeds of)Tj
T*
(prowess. But towards the latter end of the winter the king summoned a Thing, and great numbers)Tj
T*
(came. The king stood up and spoke. He began his speech thus: "You all know that last autumn there)Tj
T*
(came hither a man who is the son of my daughter, and high-born also on his fatherís side; and it seems)Tj
T*
(to me that Olaf is a man of such prowess and courage that here such men are not to be found. Now I)Tj
T*
(offer him my kingdom after my day is done, for Olaf is much more suitable for a ruler than my own)Tj
T*
(sons." Olaf thanked him for this offer with many graceful and fair words, and said he would not run)Tj
T*
(the risk as to how his sons might behave when Myrkjartan was no more; said it was better to gain swift)Tj
T*
(honour than lasting shame; and added that he wished to go to Norway when ships could safely journey)Tj
T*
(from land to land, and that his mother would have little delight in life if he did not return to her. The)Tj
T*
(king bade Olaf do as he thought best. Then the Thing was broken up. When Olafís ship was ready, the)Tj
T*
(king saw him off on board; and gave him a spear chased with gold, and a gold-bedecked sword, and)Tj
T*
(much money besides. Olaf begged that he might take Melkorkaís foster-mother with him; but the king)Tj
T*
(said there was no necessity for that, so she did not go. Then Olaf got on board his ship, and he and the)Tj
T*
(king parted with the greatest friendship. Then Olaf sailed out to sea. They had a good voyage, and)Tj
T*
(made landin Norway; and Olafís journey became very famous. They set up their ship; and Olaf got)Tj
T*
(horses for himself, and went, together with his followers, to find King Harald.)Tj

T*
(and the king had a conversation together, and Olaf begged the kingís leave to go to Iceland in the)Tj

(summer, "For I have noble kinsfolk there I want to go and see." The king answered, "It would be more)Tj

T*
(best yourself." Olafthanked the king for all the honour he was offering him, but said he wished very)Tj

(much to go to Iceland, if that was not against the kingís will. The king answered, "Nothing shall be)Tj

T*
(you have set your heart on it; but neither trouble nor toil shall you have over your preparations, for I)Tj
T*
(will see after all that," and thereupon they part talking. King Harald had a ship launched in the spring;)Tj
T*
(it was a merchant ship, both great and good. This ship the king ordered to be laden with wood, and)Tj
T*
(fitted out with full rigging. When the ship was ready the king had Olaf called to him, and said, "This)Tj
T*
(ship shall be your own, Olaf, for I should not like you to start from Norway this summer as a)Tj
T*
(passenger in any one elseís ship." Olaf thanked the king in fair words for his generosity. After that)Tj
T*
(Olaf got ready for his journey; and when he was ready and a fair wind arose, Olaf sailed out to sea,)Tj
T*
(and King Harald and he parted with the greatest affection. That summer Olaf had a good voyage. He)Tj
T*
(brought his ship into Ramfirth, to Board-Ere. The arrival of the ship was soon heard of, and also who)Tj
T*
(the captain was. Hoskuld heard of the arrival of Olaf, his son, and was very much pleased, and rode)Tj
T*
(forthwith north to Hrutafjord with some men, and there was a joyful meeting between the father and)Tj
T*
(son. Hoskuld invited Olaf to come to him, and Olaf said he would agree to that; so he set up his ship,)Tj
T*
(but his goods were brought \(on horseback\)from the north. And when this business was over Olaf)Tj
T*
(himself rode with twelve men home to Hoskuldstead, and Hoskuld greeted his son joyfully, and his)Tj
T*
(brothers also received him fondly, as well as all his kinsfolk; but between Olaf and Bard was love the)Tj
T*
(fondest. Olaf became very renowned for this journey; and now was proclaimed the descent of Olaf,)Tj
T*
(that he was the daughterís son of Myrkjartan, king of Ireland. The news of this spread over the land, as)Tj
T*
(well as of the honour that mighty men, whom he had gone to see, had bestowed on him. Melkorka)Tj
T*
(came soon to see Olaf, her son, and Olaf greeted her with great joy. She asked about many things in)Tj
T*
(Ireland, first of her father and then of her other relations. Olaf replied to everything she asked. Then)Tj
T*
(she asked if her foster-mother still lived. Olaf said she was still alive. Melkorka asked why he had not)Tj
T*
(tried to give her the pleasure of bringing her over to Iceland. Olaf replied, "They would not allow me)Tj
T*
(to bring your foster-mother out of Ireland, mother." "That may be so," she replied, and it could be seen)Tj
T*
(that this she took much to heart. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had one son, who was named Lambi. He was)Tj
T*
(a tall man and strong, like his father in looks as well as in temper. When Olaf had been in Iceland a)Tj

(month, and spring came on, father and son took counsel together. "I will, Olaf," said Hoskuld, "that a)Tj

(to slow speed on her side." Olaf said, "It is now as I told you,father, that I should take it very ill if in)Tj
T*
(answer \(to the wooing\) I should have to take shaming words, seeing that the broaching of the wooing)Tj

(struck me now that there must have been some flaw in the ring, and when I looked at the pieces I)Tj

(thought I saw sundry more flaws in them; yet I had a feeling that if I had taken better care of it, it)Tj
T*
(might still have been whole; and this dream was no longer." Gest said, "The dreams are not waning.")Tj

T*
(that, men say, is ícast on to the sea,í when a man loses what is his own, and gets nothing in return for)Tj

(it." And still Gest spake: "Your second dream was that you thought you had a silver ring on your arm,)Tj
T*
(and that shows you will marry a nobleman whom you will love much, but enjoy him for but a short)Tj

(time, and I should not wonder if you lose him by drowning. That is all I have to tell of that dream. And)Tj

(your husband will have taken the faith which we are minded to think is the more exalted. And whereas)Tj

(that Stigandi must be about, not far away from there, and bade him bestir himself with his men and)Tj
T*
(catch him. Olaf got ready at once and came to Hundidale, and the bonds-woman was fetched for Olaf)Tj
T*
(to have talk of her. Olaf asked her where the lair of Stigandi was. She said she did not know. Olaf)Tj
T*
(offered to pay her money if she would bring Stigandi within reach of him and his men; and on this)Tj
T*
(they came to a bargain together. The next day she went out to herd her cattle, and Stigandi comes that)Tj
T*
(day to meet her. She greeted him well, and offers to look through \(the hair of\) his head. He laid his)Tj
T*
(head down on her knee, and soon went to sleep. Then she slunk away from under his head, and went to)Tj
T*
(meet Olaf and his men, and told them what had happened. Then they went towards Stigandi, and took)Tj
T*
(counsel between them as to how it should not fare with him as his brother, that he should cast his)Tj
T*
(glance on many things from which evil would befall them. They take now a bag, and draw it over his)Tj
T*
(head. Stigandi woke at that, and made no struggle, for now there were many men to one. The sack had)Tj
T*
(a slit in it, and Stigandi could see out through it the slope on the other side; there the lay of the land)Tj
T*
(was fair, and it was covered with thick grass. But suddenly something like a whirlwind came on, and)Tj
T*
(turned the sward topsy-turvy, so that the grass never grew there again. It is now called Brenna. Then)Tj
T*
(they stoned Stigandi to death, and there he was buried under a heap of stones. Olaf kept his word to the)Tj
T*
(bonds-woman, and gave her her freedom, and she went home to Herdholt. Hallbjorn Whetstone-eye)Tj
T*
(was washed up by the surf a short time after he was drowned. It was called Knorstone where he was)Tj
T*
(put in the earth, and his ghost walked about there a great deal. There was a man named Thorkell Skull)Tj
T*
(who lived at Thickshaw on his fatherís inheritance. He was a man of very dauntless heart and mighty)Tj
T*
(of muscle. One evening a cow was missing at Thickshaw, and Thorkell and his house-carle went to)Tj
T*
(look for it. It was after sunset, but was bright moonlight. Thorkell said they must separate in their)Tj
T*
(search, and when Thorkell was alone he thought he saw the cow on a hill-rise in front of him, but)Tj
T*
(when he came up to it he saw it was Whetstone-eye and no cow. They fell upon each in mighty)Tj
T*
(strength. Hallbjorn kept on the defensive, and when Thorkell least expected it he crept down into the)Tj
T*
(earth out of his hands. After that Thorkell went home. The house-carle had come home already, and)Tj
T*
(had found the cow. No more harm befell ever again from Hallbjorn. Thorbjorn Skrjup was dead by)Tj
T*
(then, and so was Melkorka, and they both lie in a cairn in Salmon-river-Dale. Lambi, their son, kept)Tj

T*
(thought of by people than his father had been, chiefly because of his motherís relations; and between)Tj
T*
(him and Olaf there was fond brotherhood. Now the winter next after the killing of Kotkell passed)Tj

(said, "You are very deft at swimming. Are you as good at other deeds of prowess as at this?" Kjartan)Tj
T*
(answered rather coldly, "It was said when I was in Iceland that the others kept pace with this one. But)Tj
T*
(now this one is not worth much." The townsman replied, "It makes some odds with whom you have)Tj

T*
(many people came to the town at the summons of King Olaf. Many people had become Christains in)Tj

(Thrandhome, yet there were a great many more who withstood the king. One day the king had a)Tj

(meeting out at Eyrar, and preached the new faith to men - a long harangue and telling. The people of)Tj

(Thrandhome had a whole host of men, and in turn offered battle to the king. The king said they must)Tj

(Kjartan said, "We thank you, king, that you grant safe peace unto us, and the way whereby you may)Tj

(most surely draw us to take the faith is, on the one hand, to forgive us great offences, and on the other)Tj
T*
(to speak in this kindly manner on all matters, in spite of your this day having us and all our concerns in)Tj

(your power even as it pleases you. Now, as for myself, I shall receive the faith in Norway on that)Tj

(understanding alone that I shall give some little worship to Thor the next winter when I get back to)Tj

(a while many men egged the king on to force Kjartan and his followers to receive the faith, and)Tj

T*
(no man so much as your foster-brother Bolli, and it is my wish that you should come, for things will)Tj
T*
(soon settle themselves between you, kinsmen, if you meet each other." Kjartan did as his father bade)Tj
T*
(him. He took the scarlet clothes that King Olaf had given him at parting, and dressed himself gaily; he)Tj

(girded his sword, the kingís gift, on; and he had a gilt helm on his head, and on his side a red shield)Tj

(from far and near throughout the countrysides, and people came from the west from Midfirth and from)Tj
T*

T*
(together. It was the talk of all folk how strikingly Kjartan showed above other men. Now the sports)Tj

T*
(would show your courtesy in this." Kjartan said, "I have been training for sports but little of late, for)Tj
T*
(there were other things to do with King Olaf, but I will not refuse you this for once." So Kjartan now)Tj

(concerning those men who have come from the farthest hither, that they all stay here over night and)Tj
T*
(take up the pastime again to-morrow." At this message there was made a good cheer, and the offer)Tj

(deemed worthy of a great man. Kalf Asgeirson was there, and he and Kjartan were dearly fond of each)Tj
T*
(other. His sister Hrefna was there also, and was dressed most showily. There were over a hundred)Tj
T*
(\(<i>i.e.</i> over 120\) men in the house that night. And the next day sides were divided for the games)Tj
T*
(again. Kjartan sat by and looked on at the sports. Thurid, his sister, went to talk to him, and said, "It is)Tj
T*
(told me, brother, that you have been rather silent all the winter, and men say it must be because you)Tj
T*
(are pining after Gudrun, and set forth as a proof thereof that no fondness now is shown between you)Tj

T*
(seems your best counsel to marry, as you bespoke it last summer, although the match be not altogether)Tj
T*
(even for you, where Hrefna is, for such a match you cannot find within this land. Asgeir, her father, is)Tj
T*
(a noble and a high-born man, and he does not lack wealth wherewith to make this match fairer still;)Tj
T*
(moreover, another daughter of his is married to a mighty man. You have also told me yourself that)Tj
T*
(Kalf Asgeirson is the doughtiest of men, and their way of life is of the stateliest. It is my wish that you)Tj
T*
(go and talk to Hrefna, and I ween you will find that there great wits and goodliness go together.")Tj
T*
(Kjartan took this matter up well, and said she had ably pleaded the case. After this Kjartan and Hrefna)Tj
T*
(are brought together that they may have their talk by themselves, and they talked together all day. In)Tj
T*
(the evening Thurid asked Kjartan how he liked the manner in which Hrefna turned her speech. He was)Tj
T*
(well pleased about it, and said he thought the woman was in all ways one of the noblest as far as he)Tj
T*
(could see. The next morning men were sent to Asgeir to ask him to Asbjornness. And now they had a)Tj
T*
(parley between them on this affair, and Kjartan wooed Hrefna, Asgeirís daughter. Asgeir took up the)Tj
T*
(matter with a good will, for he was a wise man, and saw what an honourableoffer was made to them.)Tj
T*
(Kalf, too, urged the matter on very much, saying, "I will not let anything be spared \(towards the)Tj
T*
(dowry\)." Hrefna, in her turn, did not make unwilling answers, but bade her father follow his own)Tj
T*
(counsel. So now the match was covenanted and settled before witnesses. Kjartan would hear of)Tj
T*
(nothing but that the wedding should be held at Herdholt, and Asgeir and Kalf had nothing to say)Tj
T*
(against it. The wedding was then settled to take place at Herdholt when five weeks of summer had)Tj
T*
(passed. After that Kjartan rode home with great gifts. Olaf was delighted at these tidings, for Kjartan)Tj
T*
(was much merrier than before he left home. Kjartan kept fast through Lent, following therein the)Tj

T*

T*
(and looked at it a while, but said no word of praise or blame. After that Hrefna put it back, and they)Tj

(being thus overborne by these folk of Laugar." The day that men were to ride away from the feast)Tj

T*
(we think has slipped into your own keep. This harvest, when we gave a feast at Herdholt, my sword)Tj

(which men will esteem a thing of price. Come what may, I will have them both back." Bolli answered,)Tj

("What you put down to me, Kjartan, is not my fault, and I should have looked for anything else from)Tj

(you sooner than that you would charge me with theft." Kjartan says, "I must think that the people who)Tj

(to make things good if you but would. You affront us far beyond necessity, and long we have kept)Tj

(should not smoke. Now, let it be granted, as you say, that there be some people here who have put)Tj

T*
(and thought it by much a greater and worse disgrace than if Kjartan had even killed a man or two of)Tj

(was that he was drained of money, and that he thought ill-will was swelling too much between the)Tj

(people of the countryside, he himself being a friend of either side. Bolli thought he would like to buy)Tj
T*
(the land and settle down on it, for the men of Laugar had little land and much cattle. Bolli and Gudrun)Tj

(would be unbecoming to him, "For the price that Bolli has offered for the land is liberal, and is to be)Tj

(say within this countryside, being more ready, however, to do the will of others than that of the men of)Tj

T*
(most to my mind that this bargain should be left alone as I and Bolli have settled it." Kjartan said, "I)Tj

(do not call that a sale of land which is not bound by witnesses. Now you do one of two things, either)Tj

T*
(Kjartan where he was minded to go. He said he was going west to Saurby. She asked, "Which road)Tj
T*
(will you take?" Kjartan replied, "I am going by SÊlingsdale to the west, and by Swinedale from the)Tj
T*
(west." She asked how long he would be. Kjartan answered, "Most likely I shall be riding from the west)Tj
T*
(next Thursday \(the fifth day of the week\)." "Would you do an errand for me?" said Thorhalla. "I have)Tj
T*
(a kinsman west at Whitedale and Saurby; he has promised me half a markís worth of homespun, and I)Tj
T*
(would like you to claim it for me, and bring it with you from the west." Kjartan promised to do this.)Tj

T*
(had no wound as yet. Kjartan fought so swiftly and dauntlessly that Osvifís sons recoiled and turned to)Tj

T*
(home if you meant quietly to stand by? Now the choice lies before you, to help one side or the other,)Tj
T*
(and try now how Footbiter will do." Bolli made as if he did not hear. And when Ospak saw that they)Tj

T*
(me the sword Skofnung, for then I ween I shall be able to overcome a mere runagate, be he never so)Tj

(mighty a man of his hands." "You must have your way in this," said Eid, "but it will not come to me)Tj

(unawares, if, some day, you should come to rue this wilfulness. But inasmuch as you will have it that)Tj
T*
(you are doing this for my sake, what you ask for shall not be withheld, for I think Skofnung well)Tj

(bestowed if you bear it. But the nature of the sword is such that the sun must not shine upon its hilt,)Tj
T*
(nor must it be drawn if a woman should be near. If a man be wounded by the sword the hurt may not)Tj

(That winter the brothers would always be meeting, having talks together, and took no pleasure in)Tj
T*
(games or any other pastime; and one time, when Thorleik was at Tongue, the brothers talked day and)Tj
T*
(night together. Snorri then thought he knew that they must be taking counsel together on some very)Tj
T*
(great matter, so he went and joined the talk of the brothers. They greeted him well, but dropped their)Tj
T*
(talk forthwith. He took their greeting well; and presently Snorri spoke: "What are you taking counsels)Tj
T*
(about so that ye heed neither sleep nor meat?" Bolli answers: "This is no framing of counsels, for that)Tj
T*
(talk is one of but little mark which we talk together." Now Snorri found that they wanted to hide from)Tj
T*
(him all that was in their minds, yet misdoubted him, that they must be talking chiefly of things from)Tj
T*
(which great troubles might arise, in case they should be carried out. He \(Snorri\) spoke to them: "This I)Tj
T*
(misdoubt me now, that it be neither a vain thing nor a matter of jest you are talking about for such long)Tj
T*
(hours together, and I hold you quite excused, even if such should be the case. Now, be so good as to)Tj
T*
(tell it me and not to hide it away from me. We shall not, when gathered all together, be worse able to)Tj
T*
(take counsel in this matter, for that I shall nowhere stand in the way of anything going forward)Tj
T*
(whereby your honour grows the greater." Thorleik thought Snorri had taken up their case in a kindly)Tj
T*
(manner, and told him in a few words their wishes, and how they had made up their minds to set on the)Tj
T*
(sons of Olaf, and to put them to sore penalties; they said that now they lacked of nothing to bring the)Tj
T*
(sons of Olaf to terms of equality, since Thorleik was a liegeman of King Olaf, and Bolli was the)Tj
T*
(son-in-law of such a chief as Snorri was. Snorri answered in this way: "For the slaying of Bolli enough)Tj
T*
(has come in return, in that the life of Helgi Hardbeinson was paid therefor; the troubles of men have)Tj
T*
(been far too great already, and it is high time that now at last they be put a stop to." Bolli said, "What)Tj
T*
(now, Snorri? are you less keen now to stand by us than you gave out but a little while ago? Thorleik)Tj
T*
(would not have told you our mind as yet if he had first taken counsel with me thereon. And when you)Tj
T*
(claim that Helgiís life has come in revenge for Bolli, it is a matter well known to men that a money)Tj
T*
(fine was paid for the slaying of Helgi, while my father is still unatoned for." When Snorri saw he could)Tj
T*
(not reason them into a change of mind, he offered them to try to bring about a peaceful atonement)Tj
T*
(between them and the sons of Olaf, rather than that any more manslaughters should befall; and the)Tj
T*
(brothers agreed to this. Then Snorri rode with some men to Herdholt. Halldor gave him a good)Tj
T*
(welcome,and asked him to stay there, but Snorri said he must ride back that night. "But I have an)Tj
T*
(urgent errand with you." So they fell to talking together, and Snorri made known his errand, saying it)Tj
T*
(had come to his knowledge that Thorleik and Bolli would put up with it no longer that their father)Tj
T*
(should be unatoned at the hands of the sons of Olaf. "And now I would endeavour to bring about)Tj
T*
(peace, and see if an end cannot be put to the evil luck that besets you kinsmen." Halldor did not flatly)Tj
T*
(refuse to deal further with the case. "I know only too well that Thorgils Hallason and Bolliís sons were)Tj
T*
(minded to fall on me and my brothers, until you turned elsewhere their vengeance, so that)Tj
T*
(thence-forward it seemed to them best to slay Helgi Hardbeinson. In these matters you have taken a)Tj
T*
(good part, whatever your counsels may have been like in regard to earlier dealings between us)Tj
T*
(kinsmen." Snorri said, "I set a great store by my errand turning out well and that it might be brought)Tj
T*
(about which I have most at heart, that a sound peace should be settled between you kinsmen; for I)Tj
T*
(know the minds of the men who have to deal with you in this case so well, that they will keep)Tj

(After the peace between Bolli and Thorleik and the sons of Olaf had been settled and Thorleik had)Tj

(been one winter in Iceland, Bolli made it known that he was minded to go abroad. Snorri, dissuading)Tj

(On Maundy Thursday, early in the morning, Thorkell got ready for his journey. Thorstein set himself)Tj
T*
(much against it: "For the weather looks to me uncertain," said he. Thorkell said the weather would do)Tj
T*
(all right. "And you must not hinder me now, kinsman, for I wish to be home before Easter." So now)Tj
T*
(Thorkell ran out the ferry-boat, and loaded it. But Thorstein carried the lading ashore from out the boat)Tj
T*
(as fast as Thorkell and his followers put it on board. Then Thorkell said, "Give over now, kinsman,)Tj
T*
(and do not hinder our journey this time; you must not have your own way in this." Thorstein said, "He)Tj
T*
(of us two will now follow the counsel that will answer the worst, for this journey will cause the)Tj
T*
(happening of great matters." Thorkell now bade them farewell till their next meeting, and Thorstein)Tj
T*
(went home, and was exceedingly downcast. He went to the guest-house, and bade them lay a pillow)Tj
T*
(under his head, the which was done. The servant-maid saw how the tears ran down upon the pillow)Tj
T*
(from his eyes. And shortly afterwards a roaring blast struck the house, and Thorstein said, "There, we)Tj
T*
(now can hear roaring the slayer of kinsman Thorkell." Now to tell of the journey of Thorkell and his)Tj
T*
(company: they sail this day out, down Broadfirth, and were ten on board. The wind began to blow very)Tj
T*
(high, and rose to full gale before it blew over. They pushed on their way briskly, for the men were)Tj
T*
(most plucky. Thorkell had with him the sword Skofnung, which was laid in the locker. Thorkell and)Tj
T*
(his party sailed till they came to Bjornís isle, and people could watch them journey from both shores.)Tj
T*
(But when they had come thus far, suddenly a squall caught the sail and overwhelmed the boat. There)Tj
T*
(Thorkell was drowned and all the men who were with him. The timber drifted ashore wide about the)Tj
T*
(islands, the corner-staves \(pillars\) drove ashore in the island called Staff-isle. Skofnung stuck fast to)Tj
T*
(the timbers of the boat, and was found in Skofnungs-isle. That same evening that Thorkell and his)Tj
T*
(followers were drowned, it happened at Holyfell that Gudrun went to the church, when other people)Tj
T*
(had gone to bed, and when she stepped into the lich-gate she saw a ghost standing before her. He)Tj
T*
(bowed over her and said, "Great tidings, Gudrun." She said, "Hold then your peace about them,)Tj
T*
(wretch." Gudrun went on to the church, as she had meant to do, and when she got up to the church she)Tj
T*
(thought she saw that Thorkell and his companions were come home and stood before the door of the)Tj
T*
(church, and she saw that water was running off their clothes. Gudrun did not speak to them, but went)Tj
T*
(into the church, and stayed there as long as it seemed good to her. After that she went to the)Tj
T*
(guest-room, for she thought Thorkell and his followers must have gone there; but when she came into)Tj
T*
(the chamber, there was no one there. Then Gudrun was struck with wonder at the whole affair. On)Tj
T*
(Good Friday Gudrun sent her men to find out matters concerning the journeying of Thorkell and his)Tj
T*
(company, some up to Shawstrand and some out to the islands. By then the flotsam had already come to)Tj
T*
(land wide about the islands and on both shores of the firth. The Saturday before Easter the tidings got)Tj
T*
(known and great news they were thought to be, for Thorkell had been a great chieftain. Thorkell was)Tj
T*
(eight-and-forty years old when he was drowned, and that was four winters before Olaf the Holy fell.)Tj
T*
(Gudrun took much to heart the death of Thorkell, yet bore her bereavement bravely. Only very little of)Tj
